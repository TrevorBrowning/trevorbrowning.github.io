## DevLog #1: Why I’m Building 14 Projects (and What Comes After)

Earlier this week, I gave myself a challenge: **build 14 small Python projects in 14 days.**  
The original plan was simple — stick to basic CLI apps, focus on core Python concepts, and keep the momentum going.

But a few projects in, I decided to raise the bar.

I’ve tried learning to code on and off for the past few years using all kinds of resources — tutorials, videos, docs. But I kept getting stuck.

Eventually, I realized the problem wasn’t knowledge — it was practice. So I decided to stop looping through the syntax and actually put it to use.

I created a spreadsheet and mapped out 14 days. Each day would be a new project. No filler. Just build something real in 3–4 hours and ship it. Simple tools. Simple structure. Complete focus.

## Why GUI?

The original plan was all CLI. But once I got started, I realized that adding even simple GUIs made these projects feel more complete. More usable. More mine.

So I leaned in.

Even simple interface work forced me to learn things I hadn't touched before — layout systems, file handling, keyboard bindings, packaging apps as `.exe` files, and how to keep code organized as projects grow.

I’ve learned way more in a few days than I had in two years of “learning to learn.”

## What I’ve Built So Far

Here are a few of the apps I’ve completed so far:

- A file renamer with batch handling and live previews  
- A simple calculator with full keyboard support  
- A journaling app with autosave and focus mode  
- A time tracker for logging hours spent on this challenge  
- A password generator with strength options and CSV export  
- A to-do list app — my first ever GUI (TrevList)

Each project taught me something new. They all started as small ideas, and now they're open-source, usable tools I built from scratch.

## Why I’m Doing This (Learning & DevLogs)

Posting your own work for the first time is... anxiety-inducing.  
It’s easy to wonder if what you’re building is “good enough” or if anyone will take it seriously — especially when you're still figuring things out.

But I’ve decided to share anyway.

Because waiting until everything is perfect usually means never sharing at all.  
And honestly, the rough edges are where the real learning happens.

I'm not trying to build the next big thing.  
I’m not chasing polish or perfection.

I’m doing this to **learn by finishing** — to take an idea, turn it into real code, and release it. Even when it’s messy. *Especially* when it’s messy.

Before this, I worked in film production for years.  
Now I spend most of my time building tools and learning the craft of development. This challenge has helped me start thinking like a developer — not just in syntax, but in structure, decision-making, and getting things shipped.

## What Comes Next

I’ll be writing devlogs like this every few days (or at least weekly), sharing what I’m building, what I’m learning, and where I’m stuck.

No fluff. No polish. Just real notes from someone learning in public.

If you’re learning Python too, or just trying to build more consistently — feel free to follow along or drop a comment. I’d love to connect.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
