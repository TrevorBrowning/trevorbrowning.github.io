I’ve been teaching myself Python for a while, but I recently realized I needed something more structured — and more motivating.

So I gave myself a challenge: **build 14 complete projects in 14 days.**  
Each day, I:
- Come up with a small but useful idea
- Build it out using Python (usually with Tkinter)
- Add polish and features
- And then document what I learned in a daily devlog

The goal isn’t just to finish apps — it’s to build a **repeatable workflow** for learning by building and publishing.

---

## The Rules

- Each project must have a **GUI** built with **Tkinter**
- It must be **publishable** — with GitHub source and `.exe` export
- No filler projects. Even small ones must solve a real problem
- Track everything in public via devlogs and GitHub commits

## What I’ve Built So Far

**Day 1**: TrevList – a clean to-do list app  
**Day 2**: File Renamer – bulk rename tool with live preview  
**Day 3**: Simple Calculator – keyboard-friendly calculator with minimal UI  
**Day 4**: Password Generator – strong passwords, save to file, clipboard support  
**Day 5**: WriteDaily – distraction-free journaling app with focus mode

Each project is helping me improve:
- File handling and saving
- Input validation and error handling
- Clean UI design in Tkinter
- Modular code structure and functions
- Packaging and publishing for users

## What Comes Next?

Once the 14 days are up, I’ll take the strongest projects and:

- Refactor and clean up the UI
- Convert a few into **web apps** using Flask
- Host them directly on [TrevorBrowning.com](https://trevorbrowning.com)
- Possibly write tutorials or mini breakdowns of how they were built

This challenge has already helped me break through that "beginner wall." I feel more confident using Python to make useful, real-world tools — and now I’m starting to think bigger.

Thanks for reading — and if you're learning Python too, I highly recommend setting a constraint like this.  
It works.
