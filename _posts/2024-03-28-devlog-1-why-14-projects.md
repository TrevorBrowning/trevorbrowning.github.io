I've been teaching myself Python for a while now, but recently I realized I needed something more structured â€” and more motivating.

So I gave myself a challenge: **Build 14 complete projects in 14 days.**  
Each day, I:
- Come up with an idea
- Build it out with Python (usually Tkinter)
- Add styling, features, maybe even polish it for GitHub
- And wrap the day with a DevLog like this

Why? Because shipping projects is the best way to learn.

## ðŸ’» The Rules

- Each project must have a **GUI using Tkinter**
- It must be **publishable** (GitHub + .exe export)
- No filler projects â€” even if it's small, it has to solve a real problem
- Track the whole journey in a public devlog

## ðŸ”„ What Iâ€™ve Built So Far

- âœ… Day 1: TrevList â€” a GUI to-do app
- âœ… Day 2: File Renamer â€” bulk rename utility with live preview
- âœ… Day 3: Simple Calculator â€” keyboard support, eval(), styling
- âœ… Day 4: Password Generator â€” saves to file, copies to clipboard
- âœ… Day 5: WriteDaily â€” distraction-free journaling app

Each one teaches me something new:
- How to handle input validation
- How to organize code into functions and modules
- How to work with files and exceptions
- How to style a Tkinter UI that *doesnâ€™t* look like itâ€™s from 1998

## ðŸš€ What Comes After 14 Days?

This isn't just about finishing 14 apps â€” itâ€™s about building a repeatable system for learning, shipping, and iterating.

After 14 days:
- Iâ€™ll revisit my best apps and improve the UI
- Convert a few into web apps (with Flask)
- Host them on my own site at [TrevorBrowning.com](https://trevorbrowning.com)
- Maybe even start writing mini tutorials or guides based on each app

Thanks for following along â€” and if you're learning Python too, try giving yourself a constraint like this. It *works*.
