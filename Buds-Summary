should i connect it to my epic or you think make it a completely separate one?


[9/21/2021 2:17 PM] say_grr
If it was me, I'd keep them separate, just in case you get a ban one of these days.


[9/21/2021 2:20 PM] crimsonprison
rip all my items then lol


[9/21/2021 3:40 PM] icybutmelting
If you are sure about keeping/using steam, ofc connect it. If ur fine with epic, you can def change the email/password and then sell the account on Reddit


[9/21/2021 3:41 PM] icybutmelting
If you want something more secure (but you get less money from it), you can use g2g (sub-website of g2a)

[10/3/2021 9:33 AM] blissfury
You beat 4 gyms then went to a new region?


[10/3/2021 9:34 AM] trevlovespizza
I beat 6 gyms and then went to a new region


[10/3/2021 9:35 AM] trevlovespizza
Now I‚Äôm gonna have to beat more gyms and then port back to Kanto and finish up that game. But not looking forward to it lol

Nice.  You'll like it if you're down for an action paced mmorpg.  For PC, or playstation?  It doesn't have crossplay


[10/3/2021 12:44 PM] blissfury
Pc


[10/3/2021 12:44 PM] say_grr
Nice.  Once you get a little ways in, I'll come join you.


[10/3/2021 12:45 PM] blissfury

[10/3/2021 1:42 PM] say_grr
I'm a mage


[10/3/2021 1:48 PM] blissfury
I picked the same thing dang


[10/3/2021 1:58 PM] blissfury
Also this game doesn't run well üòÖ


[10/3/2021 2:09 PM] say_grr
What graphics card do you have.  I'm using a 1080 ti and it's running flawless on high settings.


[10/3/2021 2:11 PM] blissfury
Idk


[10/3/2021 2:11 PM] blissfury
Didn't build my computer


[10/3/2021 2:13 PM] say_grr
What's your in game name so I can friend you?


[10/3/2021 2:13 PM] blissfury
I have a AMD Radeon HD 8570


[10/3/2021 2:14 PM] blissfury
Also I closed the game I was lagging on low graphics


[10/3/2021 2:15 PM] say_grr
I see.  That's not a graphics card that can handle many of these games.  I'm surprised it works with rocket league.


[10/3/2021 2:15 PM] blissfury
It lags with rocket league pretty bad too


[10/3/2021 2:16 PM] blissfury
Like I get 15 fps when I'm on pc


[10/3/2021 2:41 PM] say_grr
At todays costs, for a used graphics card that would run these games would cost from $150 to run them on lower settings if you hunt on E-bay for something like an nvidia geforce 970, I was using one for a couple months before getting this 1080 ti.  I've got an Alienware R11 and R12 system, got them cheap on Ebay as people where buying them and stripping out the graphics cards.


[10/3/2021 2:41 PM] say_grr
But if I was you, I'd stick to Playstation......  You can play it on there, I just can't join from the pc


[10/3/2021 2:42 PM] blissfury
Very true


[10/3/2021 2:42 PM] blissfury
I'm sure a new pc will come into the house sooner than later


[10/3/2021 2:44 PM] say_grr
Nice.  Do your homework.  Lots of sellers are overpriced and make lots of claims(You can play this or that) but don't mention it's on the lowest settings running at less than 30 fps........


[10/3/2021 3:08 PM] say_grr
Both of my teamates tried forfeiting down by 3 with 3 minutes left.......  Came back for the win 4 - 3.  Thye should remove the ff from casual

Nice! If you want to know Bakkesmod presets if u eventually switch, it was the directional arrows:
Up - Start Dribble
Down - Pass Ball
Left - Launch Ball
Right - Take Possession


[10/13/2021 11:10 AM] icybutmelting
The launch would always be towards the backboard, and the take possession would roll towards you. Either way, it‚Äôs super cool they‚Äôre adding this

That sucks.  The reason I like New World is the way they use grass, unlike the demo shown of Elden Ring which looks like a cheap mmo grass placement and lots of rocks........


[10/18/2021 11:00 AM] icybutmelting
To be fair, it was an incomplete game leak taken at 30 fps on an xbox one (old gen). Plus, it's the gameplay and worldbuilding that heavily carries FromSoftware games, not the graphics


[10/18/2021 11:01 AM] icybutmelting
George R.R. Martin (writer of game of thrones) directed the storyline for the game, btw!


[10/18/2021 11:03 AM] say_grr
True.  I just hate when they try to make it as realistic as possible, then put zero detail into the grass/land that looks anywhere realistic.  I can't keep areas of my lawn without weeds, yet some games have all grass in areas where you know it's not getting mowed.......


[10/18/2021 11:03 AM] icybutmelting
True! I never thought of that lol


[10/18/2021 11:03 AM] icybutmelting
Water physics in some games can be hilariously bad too


[10/18/2021 11:04 AM] say_grr
It's the one thing that bothers me about many video games.  But only if they are trying for a realistic look.


[10/18/2021 11:05 AM] say_grr
Water physics is hard to get right.  But grass placement is all up to the developers as to how they want the grass to look.  Yes, grass is a little difficult as there are many blades of grass, but adding other things like weeds or using grass that is tall, not mowed, would make a big difference in some games.

[10/18/2021 11:14 AM] say_grr
They make it look like a bunch of animals have been grazing the land instead of it being mowed down, lol

I was thinking that as well.  I'm downloading the knockout city game.  I'm also downloading the Totally unreliable delivery service game(it's on PS Now) to play with my son.  That one might be interesting as well, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price if you don't have PS Now.

Lesson learned.  No Rocket League while uploading a video.  Ping never dropped below 400 for the whole game, lol.  Uploading every match from the tourney last night from the "director" perspective, with shot replays of our team.  Just a quick edit that is 17 minutes long  in total, but a 2 hour upload.

If you're looking for some musical talent, this guy uses a loop pedal, sets up the tracks from a huge list of songs(each instrument) then bolts out some hits!  He also plays a little rocket league, says he's champ but I haven't tried hitting him up.  https://www.twitch.tv/tylerlevsmusic

Yeah, all the wood and acrylic parts, not the metal or the pen mechanisms.  The pen with the celtic design on it is inlay.  It's cut at 45 degree angles with slivers of walnut glued in between, rotated and repeated 4 times.  Then when it's turned down, it gets that design.

Just got an invite in SS from the guy I think introduced me to TREV way back in the day.  I still remember Trev in the background saying "Tell him to check out my channel" not knowing I can hear everything he was saying as I was watching godbirch's stream.  He's the guilty party, Just so you know, lol


[12/6/2021 2:57 PM] trevlovespizza

I was having issues before the tourney so I didn't stream it myself.  Next week I plan on streaming it as well.


[12/6/2021 8:49 PM] trevlovespizza
The one you guys got for the open goal in the semis?


[12/6/2021 8:50 PM] trevlovespizza
Def should. Way easier to watch you guys


[12/6/2021 9:20 PM] say_grr
It was in the finals.   When they were streaming themselves by accident.  As soon as the screen comes back I'm making the demo and you get to see it in the replays.  2:18:40 in the timestamp


[12/6/2021 9:21 PM] say_grr
It was a weak clear that I overshot, but switched cameras quickly and decided to go savage!


[12/6/2021 9:22 PM] trevlovespizza
@Grr8-_-Ness yep that‚Äôs the one I meant! I thought it was in the semis for some reason but yes, perfect demo to an easy goal lol


[12/6/2021 9:23 PM] say_grr
And when watching the replay, I actually tossed that first game not knowing iCy was coming up for that shot.


[12/6/2021 9:29 PM] say_grr
At 2:24:10, I took it up their wall and was going to pass it down to iCy, I saw Orange and went for it not knowing that Orange was coming right at the ball as well.........  Other than a couple little mistakes, like me not getting back fast enough for a couple goals, we could have had that!


[12/6/2021 9:34 PM] trevlovespizza
@Grr8-_-Ness  Oh 100%. Just a few mistakes, but those are easy to correct and just be better next time! I think there was one I saw where you two were pushing on offense and they beat you to the ball on your left side and you turn around but the wrong way and a bit of a wide turn and got beat back to your goal and couldn‚Äôt save it. Just little mistakes that‚Äôs nice being able to see in replay so you can adjust that in the future!


[12/6/2021 9:37 PM] say_grr
Yeah, I turned slowly a couple times and tried relying on a tank of boost without flips........  Lesson learned.  Time to master that speed flip and get the cancel timing and recovery down.

Speedflipping is very overrated for kickoff ngl. Ur stall kickoff is already goated


[12/7/2021 9:17 AM] icybutmelting
But to get around the field, it‚Äôs useful for sure


[12/7/2021 9:19 AM] icybutmelting
Highlight of the tourney was our passing plays for sure tho. It sucks that we lost, but ur lower left corner banger off the midfield pass was too clean


[12/7/2021 9:20 AM] icybutmelting

I haven't gone through the replays of the whole tourney yet, but yeah we had some grr8 passing plays.  You pulled off some crazy shots and we had some epic saves.  We were clicking, just had a few mistakes/missed opportunities that ended up keeping us just out of reach.  I just can't believe I dunked you by accident off the back wall when we were tied in the first game of the finals, lol


[12/7/2021 9:31 AM] icybutmelting

I got sideswipe working decently on NOX.  It's a little limited on the controls like air-roll and quick chat that you get when connecting a ps4 controller to your phone, but it still works.  Might have to stream some of that later today........

It was definitely a close series, but Furia popped off


[12/9/2021 3:05 PM] icybutmelting

That was interesting........  I was installing a program to overclock my ps4 controller.  When it went to modify and the controller disconnected, I accidentally turned on my ps4 with the same controller.  Once it finally connected, I unplugged the controller and plugged it back in.  Was working great on the pc.  Played a couple games of rocket league with a super fast refresh rate.  Well happens I was connected to my ps4 at the same time.  When I looked to see who was online, it showed ME!!!!!!  I opened rocket league on my ps4 while playing rocket league on my pc.  I didn't play games on my main, but I somehow bought a 6,500 credit package.  Getting that reversed today!

Is anyone else getting a  4K xp boost after every game labeled ‚Äúsideswipe bonus‚Äù?


[1/2/2022 9:12 PM] say_grr
I was getting it back when the event was going on a month ago.  I haven't been playing sideswipe lately though.  They may have brought back the crossover xp event


[1/2/2022 9:13 PM] say_grr
If you have the season pass as well, maxed out for the xp bonus, you'll get around 7,000 each win for each level you gained on sideswipe.


[1/2/2022 9:18 PM] lt_milkshake
So if I max out the pass on sideswipe, I‚Äôll get 7k on normal rl for every win I get on sideswipe?


[1/2/2022 9:20 PM] say_grr
When you gain a level on sideswipe, you'll get a bonus.  When you come back to rocket league, you'll get that bonus when you win a game.  These do stack, but I'm not sure how many you can stack.  The reverse is the same.  Gain a level in the rocket pass on rocket league, then go to sideswipe and get a win and gain a lot of xp there as well.


[1/2/2022 9:21 PM] lt_milkshake

[1/2/2022 9:23 PM] say_grr
If you haven't played rocket league in a while, you may be getting the bonuses you have stacked from when the event was going on.  I can't find anything about them starting the event again.

You tap it once and then choose save video.  If you double click the button, you start recording and lose the last 15 minute video(or whatever you have it set to).

[1/23/2022 11:55 AM] say_grr
Team queso didn't give BDS any room, challenging everything.  When BDS scored on them and took the lead, they scored within seconds.  Then finished both of those games in overtime.  After that, it looked like BDS just slowed down and stopped playing their game.


[1/23/2022 11:55 AM] lt_milkshake
Yeah


[1/23/2022 12:43 PM] blissfury
Why do women and children get evacuated first in a disaster?

[1/23/2022 1:15 PM] icybutmelting
BDS are completely off today. They‚Äôre about to get perfect swept by Dignitas. Already 5 games in a row where they haven‚Äôt scored


[1/23/2022 1:16 PM] icybutmelting
They gave up. They pulled out the Mercs and the Battle Buses


[1/23/2022 1:16 PM] lt_milkshake
They just seem to be slow today


[1/23/2022 1:17 PM] lt_milkshake
They‚Äôre always on the defense


[1/23/2022 1:27 PM] say_grr
They went full on iCy, lol  I would love to hear what was going on in their chat


[1/23/2022 1:27 PM] icybutmelting
Apparently MaRc was left out and didn‚Äôt know, since extra and M0nkey M00n started speaking French


[1/23/2022 1:28 PM] lt_milkshake
They had to have been trying a little, if you don‚Äôt they‚Äôll fine you


[1/23/2022 1:30 PM] lt_milkshake
And it‚Äôs a pretty hefty fine too


[1/23/2022 1:30 PM] icybutmelting
They won‚Äôt get fined bc Jstn didn‚Äôt get fined for his merc switch


[1/23/2022 1:31 PM] lt_milkshake
They wouldn‚Äôt get fined for that, but if they just blatantly stop trying they will


[1/23/2022 1:43 PM] icybutmelting
What‚Äôs crazy is that Joyo for Team Queso used to be a freestyler for Pulse clan.


[1/23/2022 1:43 PM] icybutmelting
Very rarely do freestylers become successful pros


[1/23/2022 1:45 PM] blissfury
So you're saying you got a chance?


[1/23/2022 1:46 PM] say_grr
They didn't stop trying, they stopped trying to play their game.  They stopped chasing and started playing on their back foot.  I watched repeatedly late decisions that cost them the ball and control


[1/23/2022 1:46 PM] say_grr
Along with a couple missed clears/shots

You can see the whole field through your car damn near......  If I can figure out the hitbox perfectly, it might work.


[1/27/2022 8:11 AM] icybutmelting
Idk how to insert Grr8 into Flakes (European pro who‚Äôs popular for not caring about car selection/hitboxes)


[1/27/2022 8:12 AM] icybutmelting
Flakes playstyle is the most complete opposite of yours tho. Like complete antithesis to MaRc_By_8


[1/27/2022 8:12 AM] say_grr
But They're grr8.  Have you not tried frosted flakes


[1/27/2022 8:12 AM] icybutmelting
HAHAHAHA


[1/27/2022 8:12 AM] icybutmelting
Your creativity knows no bounds, man. Well played


[1/27/2022 8:13 AM] say_grr
I tried the slow down approach with toast last night for the first 1's match.  Got destroyed.  Played fast the next match and lost by 1.......  I can't play slow!


[1/27/2022 8:14 AM] icybutmelting
Flakes‚Äôs content is interesting to say the least. He has a road to GC series where he claps ppl by doing absolutely nothing (no mechanics at all, just game-sense)


[1/27/2022 8:14 AM] icybutmelting
Toast destroyed me too tho‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs just cracked at 1s despite manually half-flipping lmao


[1/27/2022 8:14 AM] say_grr
I panic every time thinking he's barreling down on me when I can no longer see him through my car and the ball.  I'm thinking maybe a car I can see through might help that


[1/27/2022 8:16 AM] say_grr
When I practice, I cut left and right quick to see around the ball while carrying it.  In game, I panic every time......


[1/27/2022 8:16 AM] icybutmelting
RIP J, get well soon bro


[1/27/2022 8:16 AM] icybutmelting
I still panic lmao that never goes away


[1/27/2022 8:17 AM] icybutmelting
But yeah practice def makes perfect. 1v1 is a lot less about offense and more about defense until about diamond 1


[1/27/2022 8:17 AM] icybutmelting
You can basically just wait for them to pass the ball to you *with proper defense* and score an open net after they overcommit up through plat


[1/27/2022 8:18 AM] say_grr
Well, toast wasn't letting that happen, lol.  But yeah, I hear ya.  It's basically the same with 2's and 3's at that level.  Just wait for the mistake and capitalize.


[1/27/2022 8:18 AM] icybutmelting
But also you can play ultra aggressively and practice recovery mechanics


[1/27/2022 8:18 AM] icybutmelting
Both work


[1/27/2022 8:19 AM] icybutmelting
I PLAYED TOAST FOR 30 MINUTES STRAIGHT AND ONLY HAD SOLID POSSESSION LIKE 5 TIMES

Make sure to check out RL settings vids to maximize performance. I personally don‚Äôt overclock/undervolt anything, but I do use Razer cortex (frees ram and cpu for gaming) and overclock my controller (tutorials on that too)

????????


[1/29/2022 3:00 PM] say_grr
linking your rocket league account with twitch and watching the rlcs stream gives you drops every 4 hours


[1/29/2022 3:00 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I know that


[1/29/2022 3:00 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but 2 different drops?


[1/29/2022 3:01 PM] say_grr
I don't know why, but they are and both gave me something this morning


[1/29/2022 3:01 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I also heard that streamers can activate drops in their stream when watching the rlcs strea


[1/29/2022 3:02 PM] say_grr
That's only when they are streaming an actual rocket league event they are getting paid to stream


[1/29/2022 3:02 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
seriously!?


[1/29/2022 3:03 PM] say_grr
Yeah, they can't just throw it on whenever they want.  every one of them would be using it 24/7


[1/29/2022 3:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
lol


[1/29/2022 3:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Well anyways. I guess we wont be seeing Immortal anytime soon


[1/29/2022 3:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
In rocket league


[1/29/2022 3:04 PM] say_grr
I've seen johnnyboi and Athena enable it during events they were casting for RL


[1/29/2022 3:05 PM] say_grr
I think it's something they epic psyonix enables for the stream themselves.  I don't think the streamers even have access to that


[1/29/2022 3:06 PM] say_grr
Immortal will be back.  We know this


[1/29/2022 3:06 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Right


[1/29/2022 3:06 PM] say_grr
He's had it for a while.  Like my one controller, it's random, but not completely destructive of your gameplay


[1/29/2022 3:07 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hes been destroying us in 1v1s with stick drift


[1/29/2022 3:07 PM] say_grr
It probably didn't happen but a couple times during all those matches.


[1/29/2022 3:08 PM] say_grr
It's up drift on the left stick.  At most he might front flip or tilt forward in the air if he's not moving the stick.


[1/29/2022 3:11 PM] say_grr
But yeah, he was on last night


[1/29/2022 3:31 PM] say_grr
Rizzo and Trihouse have drops enabled but they are streaming the rlcs games


[1/29/2022 3:33 PM] say_grr
When I went to rizzo's channel, it showed the message for the 1 drop, but not the second like it did with the original rlcs stream.


[1/29/2022 3:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm


[1/29/2022 3:34 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, the one set of drops come from rlcs or the community, the other only comes from rlcs


[1/29/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[1/29/2022 3:35 PM] lt_milkshake

y!


[1/30/2022 2:34 PM] icybutmelting
But it‚Äôs a running joke w/ musty bc he‚Äôs lowkey one of the least talented subs from the top teams in RLCS


[1/30/2022 2:35 PM] icybutmelting
Musty‚Äôs content is too kid-oriented to be enjoyable for me


[1/30/2022 2:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so hes not good?


[1/30/2022 2:35 PM] say_grr
True, but he has his moments

Yeah


[1/30/2022 2:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

i mean i know that


[1/30/2022 2:36 PM] say_grr
I think when he's hard comming, and everyone knows what he's doing, it works out for them.


[1/30/2022 2:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
the fact that hes ssl means hes good


[1/30/2022 2:37 PM] lt_milkshake
The same could be said for jonsandman but I think we‚Äôd all clap him

NRG and FaZe just feel like superteams. I only hard support them against EU (which is the better region)


[1/30/2022 2:43 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
the only reason i know and root for nrg is because of Musty


[1/30/2022 2:44 PM] say_grr
This is a match I played earlier.  I can't get tracker to work to see what rank taht +2,000 mmr guy was.  But we were so outmatched, it gave us quite a bit of mmr.

@Grr8-_-Ness / @CrimsonPrison 

Hey, with the new drops on Twitch for Rocket League, any streamer can activate them so anyone watching your stream will get them. 

To activate: 

Go to stream settings, enable drops -

Start stream, Play Rocket League, set category/game as Rocket League in stream manager on Twitch - Drops will start

If ur vaccinated, it's likely you'll get little to no symptoms, esp since Omicron has such weak virulence. Omicron spreads like butter on hot toast tho, so yeah, everyone's gonna get it

FF after 1 minute 1v1.  I'm destroying them so hard they quit before a minute is over and I don't get the 1 out of 20 games for the gift........  Boo.  But you can forfeit after 1 minute and the game counts.  Been doing that even though I'm up every game.


[2/2/2022 10:00 AM] say_grr
A little tip to get you back on defense quicker.....  The powerslide vs the half flip.  The half flip does not always win, especially if you have forward momentum.  https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueSchool/comments/kt587s/powerslide_vs_half_flipping_comparison_tutorial/

[2/2/2022 1:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/2/2022 2:39 PM] icybutmelting
If u click the link, you already lost. Never click links sent by ppl you dont know

So here‚Äôs the thing, with us having more and more people here, I‚Äôm gonna switch a few things up so we‚Äôre not constantly spamming everybody. 

I‚Äôll set up a sort of *queue/lookingtoplay* role for people that want it, so we can use that to tag/alert when looking for other people instead of using everyone/here.  

You guys cool with that?

[2/5/2022 12:32 PM] icybutmelting
Jet lag is more of a sleep issue that happens when your circadian rhythm (the body‚Äôs natural sleep cycle) gets interrupted by traveling multiple time zones


[2/5/2022 12:33 PM] icybutmelting
It includes headaches, difficulty sleeping, and not feeling rested despite sleeping


[2/5/2022 12:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/5/2022 12:37 PM] immortalthebud

[2/6/2022 4:34 PM] blissfury
I've been around, just unsure what I want to do... so killing time with anime


[2/6/2022 4:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm which one


[2/6/2022 4:35 PM] blissfury
Demon Slayer, AoT and maybe one piece now


[2/6/2022 4:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yo the new season is out?


[2/6/2022 4:35 PM] icybutmelting
AOT s4, Demon Slayer s2, Vanitas no Carte s2, and Ranking of Kings are the only good ones out rn


[2/6/2022 4:35 PM] icybutmelting
For the winter season


[2/6/2022 4:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm ok


[2/6/2022 4:38 PM] icybutmelting
If you missed them, Odd Taxi, Mushoku Tensei (Jobless Reincarnation) and Link Click (Shiguang Dailiren in chinese) were the best things to come out 2021. All 10/10s


[2/6/2022 4:39 PM] icybutmelting
Odd Taxi is probably only enjoyable if you're an adult though. It's basically a complex murder mystery with theorycrafing in the style of a Tarentino movie

I've been letting it build up


[2/6/2022 4:44 PM] icybutmelting
nvm u got it then. Im caught up on the manga. I tried randomly watching an episode, but the pacing was so unbelievably slow. The anime isn't far behind the manga, so it makes sense tbh


[2/6/2022 4:48 PM] blissfury

We ain‚Äôt gonna force stuff on you, we just curse


[2/7/2022 12:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Well my reasoning for saying what i said is because of  1 corinthians 15:33. It says,"Bad association spoils useful habits." Or something close to that based on your version of the bible. Basically the same as the phrase iron sharpens iron.


[2/7/2022 12:32 PM] say_grr
I hate the be the spoiler, but you're not going to find the most "biblical" experience here.  We curse, me especially, we crack jokes at each other, and many other things that can be picked out of the bible as bad association.  Gonna be difficult going through life avoiding everyone that is different.  Most you can do is ensure you don't pick up the bad habits in real life, and choose where to draw the line on what habits are "enough to deem a constant avoidance" of said person or group.  You won't always be able to choose your co-workers, your neighbors, your family(and those they marry into), but you will always be able to choose what habits to pick up, the good ones that even some of the worst have, and avoid the bad ones that even some of your most respected acquaintances/family have.  Good luck and I hope you're able to see we joke a lot, but don't "commit the Evil" we joke about.......

She would be fired if the stupidest person on earth was principle


[2/8/2022 12:36 AM] icybutmelting
She doesn't sound like a very good teacher. This sounds like a great story for the journalism club/department to write about

But my principle is brain dead so ig that trumps stupid

Study finance first when you get to college. Accounting is lowkey what finance majors do when they fail too many finance courses bc accounting is easier and more forgiving


[2/8/2022 12:41 AM] immortalthebud

[2/8/2022 4:44 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
if u understand what ezekiel 23:20 is talking about then its a different story


[2/8/2022 4:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
its basically talking about the fact that God's people kept leaving him, and worshiping other gods. In that way, they were a prostitute


[2/8/2022 4:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
pretty much comparing jerusalem with a concubine who instead of staying with her man, went after other men, meaning serving other Gods


[2/8/2022 4:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Ezekiel 23 just puts Jerusalem's wickedness into a illustration.


[2/8/2022 4:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
if you think about the beginning of Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 23:1-4) it kinda becomes not confusing. Verse 4 says, "The older was named Oholah, and her sister was named Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their identities, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.


[2/8/2022 5:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
But obviously u guys dont care about that part. U only care about the pervy parts. Btw the reason prostitution was used as the illustration was because back then and even now prostitution was something that a lot of women did for money or when they were poor, and jerusalem leaving the true God and serving other gods was like the actions of a prostitute.

‚Äòtwas a joke. As someone who did a lot of Bible study growing up, I‚Äôm quite aware of its themes, motifs and metaphors lol


[2/8/2022 5:07 PM] icybutmelting
We had to find ways to make Bible study entertaining tbh. Similar to how you‚Äôd go ‚Äúturn to page 203 in the biology textbook‚Äù in school


[2/8/2022 5:08 PM] icybutmelting
You have a great explanation tbh!


[2/8/2022 5:08 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thanks


[2/8/2022 5:15 PM] blissfury
@.J just do what you want to do, and live how you want to live. That's all you need to know. If people are presenting false selves you will find out 1 way or another.

[2/9/2022 2:36 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes


[2/9/2022 2:37 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
NICE!


[2/9/2022 4:40 PM] icybutmelting
@.J honestly I‚Äôd say you should grind shooting packs. After defending you for a couple weeks, I notice you almost never go for long shots. Hit ball hard and ur GC, no cap


[2/9/2022 4:41 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs just very easy to defend someone who doesn‚Äôt really shoot the ball. You make defenders only have to deal with half the options if ur not a shooting threat from the entire field


[2/9/2022 4:42 PM] icybutmelting
You‚Äôd be surprised how often C3s just don‚Äôt defend their net.


[2/9/2022 5:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmmmm


[2/9/2022 5:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thanks for the advice @DG iCy. What made u say that though?


[2/9/2022 5:42 PM] icybutmelting
Bc you‚Äôre already pretty good at everything else. In multiple days of playing with you, I‚Äôve realized you don‚Äôt really ever shoot directly (which makes it very easy to defend and challenge u). Higher champs and GCs will realize that and adapt early in games if u don‚Äôt add shooting to ur arsenal

[2/9/2022 6:11 PM] blissfury
Such great advice, what an admirable guy


[2/9/2022 6:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Shoot directly? What do u mean?


[2/9/2022 6:34 PM] blissfury
You dribble and flick but don't take shots?..


[2/9/2022 6:36 PM] blissfury
So take more shots around half field


[2/9/2022 6:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm


[2/9/2022 6:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ok


[2/9/2022 6:53 PM] icybutmelting
If the ball is near your net and the defender(s) are not defending their net, you should be able to immediately shoot it across the entire field into their net. No bounce.


[2/9/2022 6:54 PM] icybutmelting
And once you do that, defenders will have to respect shots, and thus give you a lot of space to do dribble/flick plays, wall plays/freestyles, etc

@everyone Alright guys, do I take the money hit of around $300 to fly home, or do I ride in a car for another 3 days?


[2/9/2022 10:05 PM] icybutmelting
If the rest of ur fam is, then I‚Äôd take the road trip. But also, won‚Äôt lodging cost the same (if not more?)


[2/9/2022 10:06 PM] crimsonprison
All the hotels were planned by my mom, so I'm not really sure, but the flights are actually really cheap now


[2/9/2022 10:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm


[2/9/2022 10:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/9/2022 11:00 PM] trevlovespizza

[2/10/2022 2:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I dont understand y someone would bully another person just because the other person is smarter than the rest


[2/10/2022 2:34 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs the thing, in middle school it was because of my last name of all things

I used to play it in high school, so I understand it, and the super bowl is an American cultural event, so I want to participate in it? I guess that answers the question


[2/13/2022 7:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i guess. So its because u hv a sense of duty to watch football since u played football?


[2/13/2022 8:06 PM] trevlovespizza

I wondered what that meant. I thought it was similar to gkys. Like "stuff you" or something.


[2/13/2022 10:09 PM] trevlovespizza
Ugh hate the rams


[2/13/2022 10:16 PM] icybutmelting
The crowd just booed Cooper Kupp lol


[2/13/2022 10:17 PM] icybutmelting

Lmao never would‚Äôve happened if tickets to the super bowl didn‚Äôt cost thousands of dollars and actual fans of the teams could be there


[2/13/2022 10:32 PM] lt_milkshake
True


[2/13/2022 10:33 PM] lt_milkshake
I hardly ever saw a bengals fan in the stands


[2/13/2022 11:11 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

like if i edit a message from 2 days ago today?


[2/14/2022 12:11 AM] say_grr
It's similar to putting a picture online.  Everything is "saved" and the person running the discord sees all the messages and their edits

{Reactions}
üëç

[2/14/2022 12:11 AM] trevlovespizza
Yes. I see original messages, as well as updated messages. There‚Äôs a mod channel here that sends a message to it with any message that has been edited as well


[2/14/2022 12:12 AM] trevlovespizza
Hell I even see deleted messages


[2/14/2022 12:13 AM] say_grr
Anytime you hit the enter button, it's done!  You can edit your text before sending and that isn't seen by anyone else, but if you send it, it's always there on a database for further reference by the owner of the site, or the person running it so they know what happened at all times on their site/service

u dont get dings everytime someone edits their message (even from 2-3 days ago) do u? probably not. You didnt notice that i changed a couple of my messages from today and yesterday.


[2/14/2022 12:16 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
you cant see everything


[2/14/2022 12:16 AM] say_grr
I'm pretty sure if he has that mod channel set to "ding" he'll get one everythime something is changed


[2/14/2022 12:17 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/14/2022 12:17 AM] say_grr
It's there for that reason, in case someone is acting a fool and changing all their texts


[2/14/2022 12:17 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i know its real


[2/14/2022 12:18 AM] say_grr
I just ding in quotes because he might have a different sound or vibrate set


[2/14/2022 12:18 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i hv it so i get dinged everytime a message happens on this discord server


[2/14/2022 12:18 AM] trevlovespizza
Yes. I get pinged every time. I shut those notifications off so they come in silently though to my phone


[2/14/2022 12:18 AM] say_grr
I only have it set for looking to play


[2/14/2022 12:18 AM] trevlovespizza
No one even uses it that‚Äôs why I just tag your name lol


[2/14/2022 12:19 AM] say_grr
I hear that.  Every other server is set to silent, only this one and the looking to play gives me "dings"


[2/14/2022 12:21 AM] trevlovespizza
And yes, I did notice it. Normally I just don‚Äôt care though because it‚Äôs not relevant to anything


[2/14/2022 12:22 AM] trevlovespizza

[2/14/2022 12:24 AM] trevlovespizza
Oh lol don‚Äôt be sorry. 
 no idea now. I have the bot auto-clear the messages after 24 hours. I don‚Äôt like clutter. Hence why I try keeping the channels organized.


[2/14/2022 12:25 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
well yesterdays and weeks ago's messages are still there


[2/14/2022 12:25 AM] trevlovespizza
Yes they probably are still there, because I don‚Äôt delete your messages dude


[2/14/2022 12:26 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/14/2022 12:29 AM] say_grr
It's really simple.  They have to have it in case there are arguments about what happened on the site

It's a server bot that's supposed to play music and do other things like custom welcome screens and Auto-Moderation.  It doesn't seem to be working for the music part.  Might not be enabled at the moment.

[2/14/2022 2:17 PM] trevlovespizza

The stage looked good and all, but I don't understand how they can get away with something like that inside a stadium with viewers on both sides.......  The top was great for them to perform on, but I can't figure out why they would limit the view for so many.

[2/14/2022 3:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/14/2022 3:33 PM] say_grr
You get older, have a facebook page with verifiable people that can prove your age, then sign up and wait for them to check it.


[2/14/2022 3:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
that way too long


[2/14/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i guess i can make multiple fb accounts


[2/14/2022 3:34 PM] say_grr
There is probably a lot of RL groups that run weekly tourney's.

You don't have to run with the old folks......


[2/14/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yall arent old. just not young


[2/14/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
80 is old


[2/14/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
70 is old


[2/14/2022 3:35 PM] say_grr
That's older than the average lifespan of an American........


[2/14/2022 3:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
which means that you guys are middleaged


[2/14/2022 3:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
once u hit 60 though then ur old


[2/14/2022 3:36 PM] say_grr
Tell that to my body.........


[2/14/2022 3:37 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
young is 0-27, middleaged is 28-59, and old is 60+


[2/14/2022 3:37 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
you hvnt excercised enough


[2/14/2022 3:37 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
get up and stretch, do a couple of push ups, take a walk, im pretty sure ull feel great


[2/14/2022 3:42 PM] say_grr
I'm 6'0" weighing in at 140 lbs cause I always exercise.  0 body fat!  I play the drums, run a daycare with my wife, and have 2 kids.  I get all the exercise I need.  Plus I still do my military exercises a few times a week, push ups, sit ups, etc......  When you get older, you sometimes wake up with pains, experience pains to organs that exercise can't fix, and more......


[2/14/2022 3:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i was told that getting oldER brings body pains. Wont it not hurt if u keep exercising everyday consistently?


[2/14/2022 3:47 PM] say_grr
There is a term called "over the hill".  It happens at 40 and from that moment on, you're screwed.  Exercise and diet can help some situations, but it won't stop everything.


[2/14/2022 3:49 PM] say_grr
I didn't believe it until I hit it......  The thing is, you're not exercising while you sleep or stretching and at an older age, certain movements or positions can leave you in pain for days.


[2/14/2022 3:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmmm


[2/14/2022 3:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

Crimson had to go near the end of game 1


[2/15/2022 8:00 PM] say_grr

[2/20/2022 7:14 AM] say_grr
That's much better than $5.00 a month


[2/20/2022 7:15 AM] say_grr
Is it .83 for the first month, then $5.00 after?


[2/20/2022 7:48 AM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs 0.83 (x2) monthly as long as I keep my nitro subscription, which renews yearly for me anyway lol


[2/20/2022 7:48 AM] icybutmelting
Everyone should be able to stream their gameplay in HD now, and the chat audio should be better I think


[2/20/2022 7:49 AM] say_grr
Sounds like it's just cheaper to get nitro if you plan on boosting 2 or more servers, lol


[2/20/2022 7:49 AM] icybutmelting
Yeah exactly, idc about other servers tho lol


[2/20/2022 7:49 AM] say_grr

I *still* can‚Äôt get over the fact George R.R. Martin wrote the story to this game.


[2/20/2022 7:52 AM] icybutmelting
Hopefully it has a better ending than Game of Thrones tho

Maybe I should have watched the whole video, lol.  They talk about joining friends at 5:30


[2/20/2022 7:57 AM] icybutmelting
Elden ring multiplayer is basically co-op running the single player world (helping ppl) and invading other ppl‚Äôs single player world (hurting ppl). There‚Äôs also going to be dedicated pvp servers


[2/20/2022 7:58 AM] say_grr
Nice.  The reason I liked New World was their open world where you can follow a group doing something and follow them to complete it.


[2/20/2022 7:59 AM] say_grr
Kind of like Fallout, unless you enter a building


[2/20/2022 8:00 AM] icybutmelting
Only difference is the gameplay/mechanics of dark souls games are astronomically better than basically every game out. It‚Äôs the only series ik that can consistently bring you back to that childhood fantasy of enjoying a difficult video game


[2/20/2022 8:01 AM] say_grr

Honestly the only thing that sucks about fromsoftware games is that they‚Äôre difficult and thus frustrating. It took me about a week to beat the *tutorial* of my first fromsoft game üíÄ


[2/20/2022 8:09 AM] say_grr
The PVP looks good.  Invading others servers to hunt them down could be fun.  How many people are going to be on a server?


[2/20/2022 8:10 AM] icybutmelting
I believe the maximum will probably be 5-6‚Ä¶ 2 invaders is the max, 2-3 co-op summons


[2/20/2022 8:12 AM] say_grr
New World puts you in a server, (for life* unless you change servers) with thousands of people, same people everyday.  Fallout has a max of 24 per server but they randomly throw you on a server.  Looks like they are planning on running a server for every person in Elden ring.


[2/20/2022 8:13 AM] say_grr
BTW:  If your lecture has started, pay attention!


[2/20/2022 8:30 AM] icybutmelting
Gotcha, totally paying attention!

Rotation controller?


[2/22/2022 7:58 PM] say_grr
There's a few Buds that are considered the "no rotation" Buds.  I know "nothing" about that.......

When Grr8, immortal, and I play, the earth itself stops spinning bc of how little we rotate XD

Ngl I suck at rotating too, I tend to just mechanic my way out of my mistakes


[2/22/2022 11:53 PM] icybutmelting
Specifically in 3s, I tend to be lost on defense and overly aggressive on offense

Btw, early reviews came in and it‚Äôs already the highest rated game of all time on metacritic and opencritic üò©


[2/23/2022 1:37 PM] icybutmelting
It hasn‚Äôt gotten below a 9/10 by a critic, and the main complaint is lack of cross platform play


[2/23/2022 2:25 PM] blissfury
Wow... how disappointing


[2/23/2022 4:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Yo guys, question. why can i see other peoples activity in my friends page, when i hv not friended them or talked to them ever.

I‚Äôm not too knowledgeable about discord, but I think if you share a server with ppl, those ppl being in that server‚Äôs voice chat(s) will pop up.


[2/23/2022 4:17 PM] icybutmelting
The bottom two are likely your friends, I think. Unfriend them if you don‚Äôt know them


[2/23/2022 5:59 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
nope never even talked to them before

North Korea aren't doing much, they're too poor to have any influence. Them having nukes doesn't really matter


[2/24/2022 9:44 AM] immortalthebud

[2/24/2022 9:44 AM] say_grr

[2/25/2022 1:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
They beat bds earlier


[2/25/2022 1:49 PM] nebula1157
Ill be honest, I want KXM to win over Misfits so EG can go to the major


[2/25/2022 1:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I just want kuxir to win


[2/25/2022 2:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
bds was reversed swept by luminosity


[2/25/2022 2:14 PM] trevlovespizza
Ah


[2/25/2022 2:15 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah went to add them before. Their logo file was being weird, decided not to add them


[2/25/2022 2:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm ok


[2/25/2022 2:27 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes


[2/25/2022 2:46 PM] icybutmelting
Ayooooo the word choice tho


[2/25/2022 2:47 PM] icybutmelting
Luminosity became a team after he did them tho, also, who would be a fan of a tox and eekso lol


[2/25/2022 2:57 PM] trevlovespizza
Ah


[2/25/2022 3:12 PM] icybutmelting
Oh yeah, by this logic, we should add Randoms for that one time they beat NRG (shoutout 2piece and Chronic lol)


[2/25/2022 3:12 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yes


[2/25/2022 3:15 PM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôd say no. Even since the implementation of the stickers, they‚Äôve been used sparingly. I think they‚Äôre there mostly for RLCS discussion, and teams like luminosity won‚Äôt last bc AtomiK is so much more talented than his tm8s and both tox and eekso traditionally have terrible egos/tm8 chemistry


[2/25/2022 3:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
arent they there for fun anyway?


[2/25/2022 3:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
why so negative? U dont think luminosity can be better?


[2/25/2022 3:22 PM] icybutmelting
Fair, but tbh, I was more looking at it from the perspective of how chaotic the team-building in EU is. The only main teams that have been together for more than a year are Vitality and BDS, and I can probably also say that Vitality and BDS might make roster changes too. Alpha54 and MaRc_By_8. being the players that leave


[2/25/2022 3:23 PM] icybutmelting
I think MaRc, AtomiK, and either Dorito or crr. (assuming Guild doesn‚Äôt work out) will make a Spanish superteam, with Alpha54 joining BDS to make a French superteam


[2/25/2022 4:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Hmm


[2/25/2022 9:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I think i found my RL routine. I play against plats and diamonds and beat the crap out of them. Then after i feel great, i jump onto my main and crush some champs

I actually went to the same high school as Deshawn! Paint Branch in Maryland. He was 2 years older and I never actually met him, but this (as well as the ‚Äúmovin like Bernie‚Äù trend) started from Paint Branch

WTF ICY ITS 6am


[2/27/2022 5:47 AM] icybutmelting
I just woke up shhhh


[2/27/2022 5:48 AM] icybutmelting
Elden ring messed up my sleep schedule so bad that it fixed it


[2/27/2022 5:48 AM] lt_milkshake
Ahh


[2/27/2022 5:48 AM] lt_milkshake
Speaking of, I‚Äôve been hearing some ppl getting rlly bad screen tearing issues


[2/27/2022 5:48 AM] lt_milkshake
You getting any?


[2/27/2022 5:51 AM] icybutmelting
I did at first but I just turned vsync back on and it stopped completely


[2/27/2022 5:51 AM] icybutmelting
I usually have vsync off to maximize frame rate for the games I play, but Elden ring is hard capped at 60 anyways.


[2/27/2022 5:53 AM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôm running it at max settings, and the only problems I have are slight frame stutters once every 30ish minutes, and grass textures popping in whenever I fast-travel


[2/27/2022 5:53 AM] lt_milkshake
Oh


[2/27/2022 5:55 AM] icybutmelting
It apparently runs even smoother on base ps4 at 30fps, which is lowkey sad, but it‚Äôs still the best game I‚Äôve ever played lol


[2/27/2022 5:57 AM] icybutmelting
If any of y‚Äôall get it, remember to turn off motion blur (idk why studios make this the default option lol) and reduce the base camera sensitivity by 2-3 (the camera moves fast af on default for some reason)


[2/27/2022 5:59 AM] icybutmelting
The only main issue on PlayStation is that enemies at a far distance are coded to run at half fps, so they look a bit jerky if you pay attention to them.


[2/27/2022 5:59 AM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs kinda weird, but I understand why tho


[2/27/2022 6:00 AM] lt_milkshake
It allows them to have them loaded in farther away but not totally kill your device


[2/27/2022 6:01 AM] icybutmelting
The gameplay is still the best on earth by far. Every single fight feels fun. What I hated about games like assassins creed, read dead 2, etc. is that the fighting mechanics just felt boring and tedious


[2/27/2022 6:02 AM] icybutmelting
Every single enemy in dark souls games requires your full attention and effort or you die lol


[2/27/2022 6:02 AM] lt_milkshake

[2/27/2022 1:08 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
am i cringe? is that appropriate to ask


[2/27/2022 1:09 PM] icybutmelting
Sometimes? Everyone is cringe sometimes though. It basically comes with socialization. Don‚Äôt worry about it


[2/27/2022 1:09 PM] icybutmelting

I‚Äôll eat pig butthole happily lol (ngl tho, all beef hotdogs taste way better imo)


[2/27/2022 1:51 PM] say_grr
It's just a joke though.  I don't like hot dogs.  Barely like brats unless they are a certain brand.


[2/27/2022 1:52 PM] icybutmelting
Fair. They‚Äôre definitely not that special, but I‚Äôm sure a gourmet homemade hotdog by a professional would knock our socks off.


[2/27/2022 1:53 PM] icybutmelting
Actually, I remember having a really good one at a baseball game when I was younger. There was half a million toppings on it, which probably helped


[2/27/2022 1:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
brats are good once in a while

If you drown it in toppings, you barely have the meat taste and it changes everything

I don't mind bologna on a sandiwch, as long as there are lots of toppings

But I don't like a grilled bologna and cheese or even a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  Not suere why, but they just don't taste right to me.

if u sear the turkey before hand with butter it tastes so good when u put it on the sandwich

Turkey and mayo sandwiches.  Not turkey slices, but leftover from thanksgiving or other times we make a whole turkey.

Dominoes has the option as a topping.  You should try it some time

I don't think pizza hut or many others do


[2/27/2022 2:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
general hack. If u order pizza to eat at home, warm it up in ur oven and put extra cheese on it


[2/27/2022 2:04 PM] icybutmelting
Speaking of cheeses on pizza, apparently Little Caesars brings down production costs by using Muenster cheese in the mix (it‚Äôs cheaper than using 100% mozzarella)

[2/27/2022 2:47 PM] icybutmelting
Some pros (ExotiiK, for example) have 0.20 deadzone and 0.80 dodge deadzone


[2/27/2022 2:49 PM] say_grr
It's nice to have a high dodge deadzone sometimes.  It prevents plat flips and also gives you the chance to lift the front of your car while at the same time double jumping.


[2/27/2022 2:50 PM] icybutmelting
Ayyjayy also has a twitch clip playing a few games with 10.00 steering and aerial sensitivity, 0.01 deadzone, 0.50 dodge deadzone. He still won those games

that time i got reincarnated as a slime has a decent amount of bass to it in fights and shit, the second season is so good


[3/2/2022 4:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im trying to find the episode where that vampire/new guy comes into play. I finished s1 and in s2 i see someone not familiar. Am i supposed to watch the slime diaries?


[3/2/2022 7:43 PM] icybutmelting
Slime diaries was rly boring imo. If ur talking about diable, he's summoned in season 2 pt 1 in the fight against farmus' army (but he makes an appearance in the teacher arc before that)


[3/2/2022 9:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Well its just that i dont want to miss anything important. i saw the beginning of the 2nd season, and saw him and i immediately thought i missed something because the guy said something about,"Lord Rimuru." If the 1st ep of the 2nd season goes on to tell the backstory then i guess everything is fine.

On my main, it only dropped my unranked to 1660, not all the way down to 1600.......  And I didn't check it on tracker network last night after our matches so the mmr change looks weird on it today after the season reset.

[3/10/2022 10:55 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and the sb planetary


[3/10/2022 10:55 AM] lt_milkshake

[3/10/2022 10:55 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yep


[3/10/2022 10:56 AM] lt_milkshake
The only ones that had good bms were the first 2


[3/10/2022 10:56 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah


[3/10/2022 10:59 AM] say_grr
I will eventually.  When trading up tournament stuff, you can combine seasons, but it will always give you the oldest season reward depending on the items you trade up.  I have some from every season to trade. Some seasons I didn't get the BM goal explosion and I'm using the newer seasons to get them until I run out of items from that old season......


[3/10/2022 11:00 AM] lt_milkshake
Remember tho, the more items you have in one trade up of a certain series the more likely your gonna get something from that one


[3/10/2022 11:01 AM] say_grr

[3/10/2022 11:01 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah i get it but its not guaranteed that ull get something from the old season if u trade it up.


[3/10/2022 11:01 AM] say_grr
Yes you will every time.  It will always give you a reward from the oldest season of the items you trade.  Does the same for blueprints.


[3/10/2022 12:45 PM] lt_milkshake
No.


[3/10/2022 12:45 PM] lt_milkshake
This is how it works


[3/10/2022 12:47 PM] say_grr
It's worked for me 100% of the time as long as I just have just one blueprint or tournament item from that series, the oldest one I'm trying to get rewards from.  Maybe I'm just super lucky, but I'm like 20 for 20, never failed me


[3/10/2022 12:48 PM] lt_milkshake
You must be a fucking leprechaun with that amount of luck then


[3/10/2022 12:49 PM] say_grr

theres no way that we would know wether one of us was alive or not unless their family member told us. like if someone just stopped coming to the discord server. We would never know.

[3/13/2022 7:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
that the patriots will dominate once again?


[3/13/2022 7:28 PM] trevlovespizza
If you like Brady, then this is good. 
If you do not like Brady, then this is not good and doesn‚Äôt apply to you.


[3/13/2022 7:28 PM] trevlovespizza
Brady hasn‚Äôt played for the Pats the last two seasons.


[3/13/2022 7:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
right. so once again?


[3/13/2022 7:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
they hvent dominated the last 2 seasons


[3/13/2022 7:29 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but they will this season


[3/13/2022 7:29 PM] trevlovespizza
Well, Brady will play again for Tampa, so NE possibly dominating will be irrelevant to this whole situation

[3/13/2022 7:31 PM] crimsonprison
Will he play for the Bucs again?


[3/13/2022 7:33 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes. He‚Äôs under contract with Tampa still. He‚Äôs confirmed to coming back with them, unless he now gets traded somewhere else. The only team is I can think would be SF.


[3/13/2022 7:56 PM] blissfury
Damn this man is making a paycheck in a day


[3/13/2022 8:17 PM] icybutmelting
I wonder if the Buccaneers basically begged him (financially) to come back bc they couldn‚Äôt sign a decent QB to replace him


[3/13/2022 8:18 PM] icybutmelting
Brady at 44 is still significantly more reliable than what‚Äôs probably available through free agency


[3/13/2022 8:31 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, Cousins just signed an extension. Without dropping a shit ton for Deshaun Watson, Bucs weren‚Äôt going to do anything and probably just ran with their young QB Kyle Trask

[3/14/2022 7:36 AM] say_grr
Mine doesn't show a tournament rank this season.  I'm pretty sure I won't have one until I join a tourney and it will depend on my 2's or 3's rank at that time.


[3/14/2022 7:51 AM] icybutmelting
Nice bro! You got this


[3/14/2022 7:52 AM] icybutmelting
From my multiple alts, I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs based off of your comp 3s rank initially, then based off of previous tournament attempts afterwards


[3/14/2022 7:52 AM] icybutmelting
We could just purposefully lose two tourney games if needed, for the 6pm (5pm eastern)

The SRSE one will probably be the "same time" as in 7 your time, but any actual RL tournament time has moved an hour

Yeah, for some reason mine are still 5, 7, 9, and 11.  I didn't check last time the time changed, but I remember back in the day it didn't change.


[3/14/2022 3:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i dont think thats true. Do u know that for sure? Also RL garage still shows the tournaments as the same times. 4:00, 6:00, 8:00, 10:00, and 12:00


[3/14/2022 3:57 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so unless they hvnt change the actual times, the tournaments start just the same as before

[3/14/2022 4:47 PM] say_grr
That's what I was saying to Crimson in the second post.  This time, they actually changed the time on the tournaments to match daylight savings.  In the past, they didn't do that.

[3/18/2022 7:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

I feel that bro, hope you have a good night!


[3/24/2022 3:58 PM] icybutmelting
our lobbies have 0 rotation and 100 trolling


[3/24/2022 4:02 PM] otassin
i can't deny it that it annoye me a little bit in the end but because i really couldn't escape u, i saw u missed me and myself jumping or flip the other way but i explode without a reason but what's annoyed me the most is that i miss 80% of the time and when i do not miss i got the most impossible situation to face to 
i will be back tho in like 1hour


[3/24/2022 4:04 PM] otassin
it's most the impossibly weird situation than the rotation,


[3/24/2022 4:04 PM] icybutmelting
Yeah, avoiding demos at higher ping feels like complete BS sometimes


[3/24/2022 4:04 PM] icybutmelting
Idk how players like oKhaliD avoid demos so well at 100+ ping


[3/24/2022 4:06 PM] otassin
oKhaliD is like a main 1S who is incredible to face against pressure

@everyone 
Thank yall so much for letting me be apart of this group and having the friendships that I do with you.  In about 3 hours I'll be set apart so no more discord for the next 2 years for me.  I've had such a fun time playing with yall and hopefully when I come back this will still be here.  While I'm on my mission I'll be able to email anyone, so if you guys would like to stay in contact with me or be apart of my weekly emails, my email is evan.rose@missionary.org.  I'll miss yall and wish you all the best

@Otassin. I'm in the SRSE server and can contact him once he gets in the general chat.  I'm also friends with Saint through Steam.  He's not on at that either.  If you're going to be around for the tourney, you can contact him there as well.


[3/28/2022 2:41 PM] say_grr
They usually stream an hour or two before the tournament......


[3/28/2022 2:42 PM] say_grr
@Otassin. It will pop up in the live-on-twitch channel here in this buds server when they get on.

Gud is iCy being able to take my "throws" and capitalize on them for many Monday night victories........  If you was Gud, you could do the same.  I never claimed I was Gud, just here to have fun.


[3/29/2022 9:43 AM] say_grr

[3/29/2022 10:05 AM] immortalthebud

[3/29/2022 10:07 AM] say_grr
Well then, ain't a single person in this server Gud as many of us have thrown matches......  Just think.  You're trying to flex your +68 mmr in 2's you have over this "70 year old"


[3/29/2022 10:11 AM] immortalthebud
Intelligence of an 80 yo with dementia but still I‚Äôm not flexing just tired of you being so ignorant u can‚Äôt realize your always out of roatatiom


[3/29/2022 10:13 AM] say_grr
My playstyle is challenge quick, iCy knows this and plays both outcomes of my challenges.  I break rotation in an attempt to always keep the ball on their end of the field.  Especially when my teammates are further away than the opponents.


[3/29/2022 10:29 AM] immortalthebud
Or when you think you can score aka always


[3/29/2022 10:29 AM] immortalthebud
U he jumping at a 90 degree angle to steal it


[3/29/2022 10:30 AM] immortalthebud
I‚Äôm fucking around btw lol don‚Äôt take this serious


[3/29/2022 10:30 AM] immortalthebud
Ur good just bad at rotations


[3/29/2022 10:30 AM] immortalthebud
Ur better than me at challenges and shii


[3/29/2022 10:31 AM] say_grr
Center/disturb/keep the ball on their end.  Like I said, I do that on purpose unless I know you're there.  I play as fast as I possibly can so when my accuracy improves, I don't have to "start over again" ata  faster speed to "git gud"


[3/29/2022 10:32 AM] immortalthebud
To be fair you need consistency which u or  me don‚Äôt have at that speed so you mise as well keep the ball and not give it away


[3/29/2022 10:33 AM] lt_milkshake
Holy fucking spelling


[3/29/2022 10:37 AM] say_grr
Sometimes I "throw it away", but I'd rather give you the ball on your end of the field while chasing it down than try to catch it not knowing if someone is coming at me full speed "chasing it down".  The term hit ball hard will help you break through GC if you're consistent with your speed.


[3/29/2022 10:39 AM] immortalthebud
That comes with field awareness know where they are


[3/29/2022 10:42 AM] immortalthebud
If you were watching icy yesterday in gc twos


[3/29/2022 10:42 AM] immortalthebud
You often hit hard yes but to a tm8 and if their isn‚Äôt one you stall


[3/29/2022 10:42 AM] immortalthebud
U just send it and it often ends up in goal on us


[3/29/2022 10:44 AM] say_grr

Friendly reminder, when bakkesmod is not updated and not working, it will not save every replay as you normally expect when playing and you may lose a nice double tap for forgetting it's not!

[4/3/2022 11:40 AM] say_grr
RL Mafia:  I've been thinking of different ways to run this.  One idea so far involves me having a second PC set up, a Twitch account for RLMAFIA, having the second PC running the private matches with an overlay for twitch.  We would vote, and see the stats on the twitch channel.  We wouldn't have to join or report who wins as that will be done automatically using bakkesmod with the SOS plugin sending the game information directly to the program I write that will be displayed on the twitch overlay.  This would work great and also give us a vod but involves having a second pc running rocket league, OBS, and RLMAFIA.  I don't know if my second graphics card(970 ti) will run that efficiently.  Worst case scenario, I can use my PC to run RLMAFIA and play the game from my PS4......


[4/3/2022 11:42 AM] say_grr
With that method, everyone would have to have the twitch channel open on something that they can also use to vote with.


[4/3/2022 12:10 PM] say_grr
Another option, I create an android app I run on my Chromebook as the host.  Create another app for players in Android and windows PC(sorry no apple as I don't have an apple pc to compile it).  Everything would be done through the app, mostly automatic for the players but as the host, I would have to enter the game information after each match. The app would be simple for users, not so much for the host.  Just click the person to vote.  Not too bad if everyone has an android device(including firetv) or windows pc but involves installing and using the app for the game.  Extra steps.....  This might be the easiest for me to get up and running if everyone has access to a windows pc or android device.  I can also set it up for HTML through a browser but that would be more work for me and puts some limits on what I can do, even though none of those limits effect the actual game code, just visuals.


[4/3/2022 12:19 PM] say_grr
Another option, probably the easiest and fastest to set up and get going, I just make a windows app the host runs and inputs all the info manually.  Before we start the names get added(the only time typing will be involved). At the end of the match the host asks each person who they vote for and the host just clicks on that person and who they vote for.  I can have this also tell us who should be on each team so the host doesn't have to do that on their end, or I could just have it set up to manually enter the teams and who won.  By manually, it's just clicks of the mouse, not hand typing everything out so it won't be that hard on the host.......  Then they can copy and paste the standings/score in discord then onto the next match.


[4/3/2022 12:25 PM] say_grr
That typing would involve their discord name so it can connect through a bot and send the Mafia information through a message similar to what we have now.

[4/3/2022 7:42 PM] say_grr
I also have 2 more r12's with 11700KF's with 16 gb ram.  One has a 970ti, the other has a quadro K4000


[4/3/2022 7:43 PM] say_grr
Just picked up one of them a couple weeks ago and will be using it as my main switching the 1080ti to it, the other still needs the water cooler installed and setup.


[4/3/2022 7:45 PM] say_grr
I payed $500 for this one without the graphics card.  $600 and $400 for the other 2 R12's that I'm not currently using, the $400 one actually came with a quadro K4000, too good of a deal to pass up.

If your interested in building your own and not sure what kind of hardware you will need for the games you play, I usually recommend NZXT build guide just to get an idea on price/power you will need. Its a good place to start. After you get an idea use PC Part Picker to change out parts if you want. GPU prices have dropped a lot compared to a year and bit ago. Now is an okay time to build one.

Bruh the past two years.. buying one already made was the only way to get a decent GPU. Everyone was sold out are marked up.


[4/3/2022 8:25 PM] say_grr
So true.  The CPU itself is over $300 on this R12 water cooled alienware I picked up a couple weeks ago for $350 + $50 shipping.  I basically got the motherboard, memory, power supply, CPU water cooler, 1tb mechanical hard drive, No SSD unfortunately, and a quadro K4000 GPU for $50


[4/3/2022 8:26 PM] say_grr
All because they wanted the GPU out of it


[4/3/2022 8:27 PM] typicalcanadian.
M.2 is the way to go nowdays to JayFly. Put your operating system on it. It will blow you away

Btw Jay, keep in mind that if ur maining RL, ur PC doesn‚Äôt need to be powerful at all. Most in game settings are best at the very lowest anyways. Having a monitor above 120hz matters the most tbh

It's basically the hills in RL ranked.  Champ is people trying to do shit they can't do 100% of the time.  GC1 is those that are near 100% effective, but at a slower pace.  GC2-GC3 is that, but at a faster pace.  SSl is that at an insane pace!


[4/3/2022 11:01 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
well im getting super good at air dribbles

No, I'm trying to keep my speed going so I can hop right past GC1 and into GC2 when I get 100% effective

I'm also planning on joining the IGL, probably next season.  If I keep below Champ 2, I can play against easier players, lol

What did yall me by stay away from GB motherboards? Is a MB with 128gb bad?


[4/3/2022 11:30 PM] say_grr
Their products aren't very reliable.


[4/3/2022 11:32 PM] say_grr
And it's a motherboard that can hold and handle 128GB, that you will have to purchase separately.  Doubt you'll want to purchase that much ram


[4/3/2022 11:34 PM] say_grr
I watch a lot of Linus tech Tips on youtube.  He has videos comparing and testing a lot of MB's CPU's, GPU's, Ram, etc.....


[4/3/2022 11:35 PM] say_grr
He also does a lot of build videos where he puts together whole pc's so you can see the process and learn even more

Gigabyte is a company, and so is MSI (both based in Taiwan). The company name is not to be confused with the term that means 1 billion bytes (gigabyte)

Another fun thing to play is weakest link. The way it works is it‚Äôs a 3v3 and whoever has the lowest points is out of the game that continues till it‚Äôs down to the 1v1 and then whoever has the most points at the end of that is the winner aka the strongest link

Mo Dao Zu Shi is the best Chinese shounen style show (8/10), but Shiguang Dailiren (Link Click) is a 10/10 masterpiece. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2

Mushoku Tensei being an insanely good isekai (re:Zero is also my shit), and shows like one punch man and mob psycho do the OP trope way better than most


[4/6/2022 11:05 PM] icybutmelting
I kinda get bored if a character is so one-dimensional if the cast is even more one-dimensional


[4/6/2022 11:06 PM] icybutmelting
My threshold for a 10/10 is if I liked the anime more than things like the dark night trilogy or breaking bad lol


[4/6/2022 11:06 PM] icybutmelting
If I manage to finish an anime, I‚Äôll always give it at least a 6/10

[4/7/2022 9:56 AM] lt_milkshake
What this for Grr8?


[4/7/2022 9:56 AM] lt_milkshake
It looks like code of an rl game


[4/7/2022 9:56 AM] say_grr
That's game information sent from rocket league that I can use in the Mafia game or overlays for twitch and such


[4/7/2022 9:57 AM] lt_milkshake
How is that helpful in mafia?


[4/7/2022 9:58 AM] say_grr
At the end of the match, It will grab the game info, who won, so I don't have to enter that manually.  It will also be able to calculate from that info everything for the server to run independently.  It will be able to tell all the players the game has started so it can change as well.


[4/7/2022 10:02 AM] say_grr
It's also one of the things I wanted for our private 2's tournaments.  I'm going to be doing something similar for that so everyone can see the scores as we play.


[4/7/2022 10:03 AM] lt_milkshake
That'll be really cool


[4/7/2022 10:03 AM] say_grr
This being my first real attempt at online gameplay, I feel it's not going too bad.  I've made a lot of single player games, just never dabbled in online connectivity and such.  But the time has come to break through that barrier.


[4/7/2022 10:04 AM] lt_milkshake
So you'd put this into a discord bot and that would put out notifications of goals and such?


[4/7/2022 10:05 AM] say_grr
No, it would be on my website, and you would visit the webpage.  Instead of boring old discord text, it will look like a full blown game.


[4/7/2022 10:08 AM] say_grr
It will receive the information for goals and even goal speed.  Everything!  I can have it display that stuff in the mafia game window, but most you'll see is what's necessary for the game itself to operate properly.


[4/7/2022 10:08 AM] lt_milkshake
So is this how they do the overlay shit for rlcs for boost and points


[4/7/2022 10:08 AM] say_grr
Like the mafia scores for each mafia player.


[4/7/2022 10:08 AM] say_grr
Yeah, this is exactly how they do it


[4/7/2022 10:09 AM] say_grr
Then they write an html file that is overlayed on OBS or whatever they use to stream


[4/7/2022 10:10 AM] say_grr
I have the ability to make HTML5 files, which is javascript.  Gives me some incredible abilities for overlays.


[4/7/2022 10:11 AM] lt_milkshake
so would it be able to see which person is the mafia automatically? like which person is supposed to throw without being found


[4/7/2022 10:12 AM] say_grr
Yeah.  The program I'm writing will calculate who is the mafia, who is on each team, and send that information to each player's browser.  They would be the only one seeing who the server picked.


[4/7/2022 10:13 AM] say_grr
You would look at the browser to see what team you are supposed to be on and if you are the mafia or not


[4/7/2022 10:13 AM] lt_milkshake
kinda like among us where theyll be told if their imposter but other wont


[4/7/2022 10:13 AM] say_grr
exactly like that


[4/7/2022 10:13 AM] lt_milkshake
this'll really be sick


[4/7/2022 10:13 AM] lt_milkshake
GL


[4/7/2022 10:14 AM] say_grr
It will.  Probably something a streamer will eventually make a video about..........


[4/7/2022 10:15 AM] say_grr
I'll have RL Mafia and a private 2's - 3's tournament setup ready to go at that time


[4/7/2022 10:16 AM] lt_milkshake
if you were to turn it into a self sustained mod in bakkesmod without the website i definitely think a youtuber would notice, but this is so good it'll prob get noticed even without that


[4/7/2022 10:20 AM] say_grr
That sounds somewhat possible, as in having the overlay on the players screen as well, not just the stream.  Sounds like a nightmare though, lol.  With this, everything is run from a browser which is accessible by all the users from any device.  They have to be able to input things like who they vote for, or if they want to gamble their points if they feel really strong about their vote.


[4/7/2022 11:15 AM] icybutmelting

Have you ever watched the college RL stream where they have a little RL game run by the chat viewers through their chat inputs?  Now when we run RL Mafia and I'm streaming, viewers will be able to vote as well and I can keep their score on twitch!  And so much more

It's having a hard time xD might be on it's death bed. Even though i turned it off the keyboard was still lighting up and the screens where not getting anything. Seems to be back for now though


[4/11/2022 10:47 AM] say_grr
Nice, might have just been hung up on close.  Mine usually does that when it's updating or something.  The screen will go off way before the keyboard and pc actually shut down and restart.

[4/11/2022 11:01 AM] say_grr
For the year and for a budget pc to run games like rocket league or other games, it won't be a bottleneck with the graphics card he is using


[4/11/2022 11:02 AM] say_grr
It's definitely not something I'd try to keep as a main for better games

it‚Äôs like fx- 6300 or smth

i test ran his pc myself when i did shit to it


[4/11/2022 11:03 AM] say_grr

or even his pc is still booting


[4/11/2022 11:04 AM] say_grr
Well, yeah, it's not top of the line, and your graphics card will take part of that loading as well.


[4/11/2022 11:05 AM] say_grr
It also depends a lot on memory and storage.  A good SSD vs a slow SSD or mechanical drive can also make a big difference


[4/11/2022 11:06 AM] Deleted User

he doesn‚Äôt have good storage either


[4/11/2022 11:07 AM] Deleted User
his windows 10 is on a hdd üíÄ


[4/11/2022 11:08 AM] say_grr
That right there is 99% of the problem.  I'd bet the CPU never reaches 100% during loading since it's going to be waiting on the hard drive more than anything


[4/11/2022 11:08 AM] lt_milkshake

then i have to do it again for it to start opening


[4/11/2022 11:17 AM] say_grr

maybe it‚Äôs just rl then lmao


[4/11/2022 11:20 AM] say_grr
It only happens to me with rl


[4/11/2022 11:20 AM] icybutmelting
It might be rocket league‚Äôs fault if it‚Äôs happening to everyone. My laptop can run Elden Ring on max settings, and that thing is very CPU/memory intensive


[4/11/2022 11:20 AM] Deleted User
mine runs at medium to run perfectly 60fpd


[4/11/2022 11:20 AM] Deleted User
high will do 58-60 or so

i do keep it at 165

cuz it‚Äôs my monitor


[4/11/2022 11:40 AM] Deleted User
i think idek


[4/11/2022 11:40 AM] icybutmelting
Same, 165 hz monitor, but I don‚Äôt think I have g sync unless it‚Äôs done automatically lol


[4/11/2022 11:41 AM] icybutmelting
I run RL at the absolutely lowest settings with the exception of high quality rendering, and also uncapped framerate bc apparently it‚Äôs better to do that


[4/11/2022 11:43 AM] say_grr
If RL is written properly, the fps should only be the graphics output, not the base code.  Everything else for the base code should run at the same speed either way


[4/11/2022 11:44 AM] icybutmelting
I have an fps counter, and the number tends to stay around 380 even tho 165hz is the max I can get lol


[4/11/2022 11:44 AM] say_grr
That's what the game is ouputting, but it's ignoring half of that on the monitor end


[4/11/2022 11:44 AM] icybutmelting
It drops to 80ish during loading screens or lag spikes


[4/11/2022 12:10 PM] hoglishva

Apparently I need 51 ish and I'm running 32 ohm amp


[4/11/2022 1:36 PM] icybutmelting
Amp? Like guitar amplifiers?

i appreciate itttt


[4/11/2022 3:29 PM] hoglishva
pretty much, my headphones need a bit more umph to get the full sound.


[4/11/2022 3:35 PM] hoglishva
Swapping from Logitech G35 (left) to Fostex T50RP (right) was great. All the sounds are more dynamic or clearer. Helped a lot for listening for footsteps in an FPS, plus all my music is better.

[4/13/2022 6:17 PM] say_grr
Other than maybe updating a driver, there isn't much to this article unless you've changed things on your pc which caused the lag spikes.


[4/13/2022 6:29 PM] Deleted User
Is driver easy safe btw @Grr8-_-Ness


[4/13/2022 6:30 PM] say_grr
I would never trust a driver software program.  Any driver can be got from the original site.


[4/13/2022 6:30 PM] Deleted User
alr ty


[4/13/2022 6:33 PM] say_grr
The article is basically just an ad for the program.  I'm not saying it's a bad program, but there's always a chance that you'll only be able to get a couple updates through it before you hit a paywall.  I read the update all requires the full program, but they don't mention how many you can do individually either.


[4/13/2022 6:34 PM] Deleted User
idek how to update drivers properly ngl


[4/13/2022 6:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ay np. must suck


[4/13/2022 6:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so i posted some ads basically?


[4/13/2022 6:35 PM] say_grr
Kinda, but the basic advice is about the same as anyone would give for lag issues.  They just advise using their program to update drivers instead of doing it yourself


[4/13/2022 6:37 PM] say_grr
You should also avoid using the compatibility mode unless completely necessary.

Classification of buds can be done based on different factors like location, status, morphology and function:¬†

__**Buds Based on Location**__
**Terminal Buds:** ¬†When the bud is located at the tip of a stem¬†
**Axillary Bud:** When the bud is¬† located in the axil of a leaf
**Adventitious Bud:** When the bud is¬† occurring elsewhere like on the trunk or on roots¬†

__**Based on Status**__
**Accessory Bud:** ¬†These are secondary buds formed besides a principal bud
**Resting Bud:** Buds that are grown at the end of a growing season, which will lie dormant until the onset of the next growing season.¬†
**Pseudoterminal:** They are a kind of an axillary bud taking over the function of a terminal bud¬†

__**Based on Morphology**__
**Scaly Buds:** When scale covers the embryonic part for protection work.¬†
**Hairy Buds:** When there is a hairy appearance for protection.¬†¬†

__**Based on Function**__
**Vegetative Bud:** If buds containing vegetative pieces like embryonic shoot with leaves
**Reproductive Bud:** Bud which contains embryonic flowers.¬†
**Mixed Bud:** When buds have both embryonic leaves and flowers.

I'm trying to find out if there is another Based on Status BUD.  One that isn't part of a defect, like a "normal" status. I did miss a bud Based on Morphology: Naked Bud:  When not covered by scales.  Can be hairy of not.  But the Naked bud changes the option of pick one from each group to choose your bud!


[4/14/2022 9:10 AM] say_grr
@DG iCy  By any chance, do you know if the other based on status bud I was referring to, would that be a principal bud?


[4/14/2022 9:23 AM] icybutmelting
Plant bio was only a small part of my curriculum, so no. Also, if this was an intricate set up for a punchline, still no üíÄ


[4/14/2022 9:27 AM] say_grr
It's not for a punchline.  Just trying to figure out what a "normal" bud would be considered under Based on Status.  What I was thinking about using this for is character creation, you choose one option from each and your character is determined by those choices.

I have another little helicopter game, but it requires the numberpad keys to move around and a couple things don't work in this html version.  It's another one I don't have the code for anymore.

[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] hoglishva
can you populate some double digit numbers to see if it fits fine?


[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] say_grr
If the first one fits everyone's screen, I'll use it so the names can fit.  I can always make it 6 players which it will most likely be


[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] hoglishva
will it ever hit 3 digits?


[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] say_grr
There's room for 3 digits in each cell


[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] hoglishva
yeet


[4/15/2022 5:22 PM] say_grr

Hey guys, question. What  effects do u like and not like when watching RL montages?


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] Deleted User
i‚Äôm not really sure


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] otassin
complex question because that depend a lot of how you use it and on what


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] Deleted User
besides the fact don‚Äôt put TOO much effects


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] icybutmelting
I guess too many filters, too much camera shake, and too zoomed in


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] Deleted User
sometimes people put too much and it just makes it too much to look at


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] Deleted User
and not exciting to watch


[4/16/2022 5:12 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

its exactly like montage of a video, too much montage is just unwatchebal (sry i dont know how to say it but u get it XD)


[4/16/2022 5:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah np tassin


[4/16/2022 5:15 PM] Deleted User
yeah since it‚Äôs such a complex question with a lot of effects and such in general throughout a video, just testing it out and sending us your end result would help us best to help you to what we think is better/worse


[4/16/2022 5:15 PM] otassin
i guess like evryone say not too much, try to match it to the song


[4/16/2022 5:15 PM] Deleted User

[4/16/2022 5:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah i already try to match with the music

scoring when the beat drops


[4/16/2022 5:15 PM] otassin
for me the song is 1st and the clips are 2nd


[4/16/2022 5:16 PM] otassin
try to do some transition too


[4/16/2022 5:16 PM] Deleted User
i agree w otassin


[4/16/2022 5:17 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i already made the montage i just hv to send it to u guys


[4/16/2022 5:17 PM] trevlovespizza
If the montage doesn‚Äôt have camera shake and unlistenable trap music I‚Äôm not interested


[4/16/2022 5:17 PM] otassin
exacly like the effects not big transition or maybe only 1 or 2 of the entire montage


[4/16/2022 5:17 PM] otassin

[4/16/2022 5:53 PM] otassin
@.J its more a compilation than a montage


[4/16/2022 5:54 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what makes it a compilation?


[4/16/2022 5:54 PM] otassin
somee moments is way more into the funny than cool,


[4/16/2022 5:55 PM] otassin
and the music is not really guiding anything because its a really chill one


[4/16/2022 5:57 PM] otassin
somes clean goal tho i still like it but its not a montage but more a compilation one


[4/16/2022 5:59 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
huh...


[4/16/2022 5:59 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so basically more clips, and different music


[4/16/2022 6:06 PM] otassin
chose different type of clips, for a montage choose almost only cool goals/saves
somes of the clips than you choose are easy to say than you don't predicted that, like 1:15
or are more funny than anything like the time when you shot to 1 enemy and they own goal it

for the music you can choose any music that you like, but for a montage the music need to guide the clips, that why its more easy with a music that have more rythms

for your goals some of the goals are clean, but there some moments when you just fail at 1st then clutch it, skip the fail moment,

if you don't have enought goals to complete the music use the replay mode and try to do some cinematics moments, you can use them as transition or to fit the rythm of the music !


[4/16/2022 6:08 PM] otassin
and also you can use the replay to do a simple thumbnail


[4/16/2022 6:08 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hmm...


[4/16/2022 6:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thanks for the advice


[4/16/2022 6:09 PM] otassin

[4/17/2022 7:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
marc by 8 will be a sub?


[4/17/2022 7:16 PM] icybutmelting
He was supposed to go to guild, but he didn‚Äôt want to leave. Guild signed Dorito instead


[4/17/2022 7:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
crazy roster


[4/17/2022 7:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
wonder how the teams will play out


[4/17/2022 7:20 PM] nebula1157
Radosin to Vitality is also gonna be crazy


[4/17/2022 7:22 PM] icybutmelting
Archie to Endpoint, and Turbo switching with Allushin are the other two big moves imo

[4/17/2022 10:04 PM] icybutmelting
Marc was Guild‚Äôs #1 target. According to Shift, MaRc would rather win worlds as a sub than move to a worse team and get playing time (plus, he will still be paid under contract I think)


[4/17/2022 10:04 PM] icybutmelting
Same with turbopolsa. Even though he‚Äôs demoted to a sub, he‚Äôs still one of the highest paid players in the world


[4/17/2022 10:05 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[4/17/2022 10:05 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

If you restrict yourself so much that replying to discord messages 2 hours later ruins ur study time, reconsider ur study habits lol

Actually, one of the best ways to retain what you've been studying is to take breaks.

[4/23/2022 5:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Even if its a bit, im gonna say cajun/a little on the dark side, id rather have that then be sick because my food wasnt cooked all the way. No offense to Canadian, it looks really delicious.


[4/23/2022 5:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
!!!!!!!!!!


[4/23/2022 5:31 PM] icybutmelting
To be fair, I never liked steak until I was an adult‚Ä¶ but also, I didn‚Äôt ever get a good steak until I ordered one from a steakhouse


[4/23/2022 5:32 PM] icybutmelting
Well done red meat is just semi-edible leather


[4/23/2022 5:33 PM] tippie2829
you dont know meet then


[4/23/2022 5:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
well tbh, ive only had my Mother's steaks and she always makes them well done.


[4/23/2022 5:33 PM] icybutmelting
The pink/red is not blood‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs heme (what makes meat tastes like meat). Overcooking it denatures the compound and literally eliminates the flavor


[4/23/2022 5:33 PM] tippie2829
chicken is like the only meat that will kill you if its not cooked

When you get older, you‚Äôll understand that your mom is objectively bad at making some foods


[4/23/2022 5:36 PM] icybutmelting
But she‚Äôs still really good at making other foods


[4/23/2022 5:36 PM] tippie2829

[4/23/2022 5:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[4/23/2022 5:38 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[4/26/2022 4:07 PM] say_grr
It's what rocket league was before rocket league became rocket league.  This is version of the game they started making that they added a ball to and turned it into SOCCAR(rocket league).  Lots of games start out as one thing then take a wild turn when something is added to the mix that the developers like better!


[4/26/2022 4:11 PM] Deleted User
it‚Äôs something different from rl


[4/26/2022 4:11 PM] Deleted User

bakkesmod is ez to get


[4/26/2022 4:16 PM] say_grr
The easier option.  There is always the change names of a certain map and replace it with the custom map.  That still works as the long way

yus


[4/26/2022 4:21 PM] say_grr
I think a lot of it depends on the monitor/tv distance.  Most console players play on a tv across the room.  The switch to a closer monitor with a console makes it much better as well.


[4/26/2022 4:22 PM] Deleted User
I played on a tv right in front of me


[4/26/2022 4:22 PM] Deleted User
from liek 10ft

and i still never improved


[4/26/2022 4:22 PM] Deleted User
i say this because i went from a stuck c1 to c3 when i switched

10 ft?  My monitor is about 20 inches from my face making this 27" monitor twice the size of my 60 inch tv on the other side of my room

i think it‚Äôs more about rl on console (ps4) from my perspective


[4/26/2022 4:27 PM] Deleted User
where it‚Äôs like


[4/26/2022 4:27 PM] Deleted User
you can only save this amount


[4/26/2022 4:27 PM] Deleted User
i had the same issue, i had a 4tb HDD with 2tb left and it still wouldn‚Äôt save any


[4/26/2022 4:27 PM] say_grr
They do it for memory.  I notice it takes forever to load my replays on my pc cause I have so many and it fills up my memory when I do so.  Just bad programming for them to code it that way


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] Deleted User
yeah same


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] Deleted User
ps4 rl already takes so long


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] Deleted User
already


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] Deleted User
for everything


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] say_grr
I move my older replays to my extra harddrive to save space and get it to load faster


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think console also has where u cant save an unlimited amount of replays


[4/26/2022 4:28 PM] Deleted User
last time i tried to play on console for rl, i couldn‚Äôt play one game

[4/26/2022 4:29 PM] say_grr
I would if I had to, but on the PC I also have the controller overclocked so I get even faster input

Thanks


[4/26/2022 4:36 PM] say_grr
This is also how I bought $50 worth of rocket league credits on my PS while setting this up and testing it..........  I accidentally hit the PS button on the controller when it was done overclocking and accidentally turned on my PS.  It was connected to both my PS and my PC.  I played a game of rocket league on my alt before I noticed my main account was logged on.  I looked and it was my PS.  Not only was my PS on with my account, it also purchased the credits!

i used to s little


[4/26/2022 4:41 PM] say_grr
I think if you connect it to your PS through bluetooth then plug it into your PC, you can control both at the same time


[4/26/2022 4:41 PM] Deleted User
but now if i do, it might be for a car or the Rocket pass

yes


[4/26/2022 4:42 PM] say_grr
That's how it happened to me.  It disconnected when it overclocked.  I had to unplug it and plug it back in to connect it again.  But before I did that, I hit the stupid PS button and connected it to my PS.


[4/26/2022 4:43 PM] Deleted User
next thing you know you have credits bahaha


[4/26/2022 4:43 PM] say_grr

[4/26/2022 4:44 PM] say_grr
Kinda down the drain.  Since I'ev played for so long, it's not the worst to actually spend some money on it

i just personally don‚Äôt care about items or anything because BM is wonderful

yes


[4/26/2022 4:46 PM] say_grr
That's a decision you should be making.  Especially if you have a schedule you want to keep to.  It can become a job that doesn't pay much for your time, but also your time is playing games.


[4/26/2022 4:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
btw i just the thing where u hold drive and the ball stays still on ur car


[4/26/2022 4:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

2K Games is Developing Rocket League Competitor "Gravity Goal"
Gravity Goal was in its closed Alpha late last year, so it's possible that the game could be announced in the coming months.

[4/26/2022 7:18 PM] Deleted User
the game may suck sometimes


[4/26/2022 7:19 PM] Deleted User
but youll have to do smth spectacular for it to get taken over by another game


[4/26/2022 7:20 PM] say_grr
I think rocket league with motorcycles(hitbox) would change the game up a lot.


[4/26/2022 7:21 PM] trevlovespizza
100% agree. People will play 2k‚Äôs game for sure but RL is an easy game to play with simple controls and an infinite skill ceiling. Once it‚Äôs on UE5 soon, it‚Äôll be unstoppable. I don‚Äôt ever see a true competitor to RL unless Psyonix/Epic do something drastic to change the base game (different physics, (for comp), microtransactions to increase stats (jump higher, faster, etc).


[4/26/2022 7:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Aint that right? RL is its own whole genre


[4/26/2022 7:22 PM] trevlovespizza
Agree Grr8. Let 2k release their game and then let Psyonix release a new motorcycle to take away the one thing they have different


[4/26/2022 7:22 PM] Deleted User
THAT WOULD BE SO FUNNY


[4/26/2022 7:23 PM] Deleted User
but what hitbox would it even have?


[4/26/2022 7:23 PM] Deleted User
it would be so skinny lol


[4/26/2022 7:23 PM] Deleted User
RL is so different, which is why it has been able to keep at least some popularity over the years


[4/26/2022 7:23 PM] Deleted User
its lost its hype since f2p but


[4/26/2022 7:26 PM] trevlovespizza
It‚Äôs the only actual true skill game, which is why I believe it should be the biggest esport. Other sports games like 2k/madden require a lot of rng with scripted events.


[4/26/2022 7:26 PM] trevlovespizza
That would be really tough to make it that thin but it could be a lot of fun. I‚Äôm sure they could do something with it lol


[4/26/2022 7:26 PM] say_grr
There will be more vehicle sports games in the future and some of them will be as big or bigger than rocket league


[4/26/2022 7:27 PM] Deleted User
If you have played many fps game or 2k, then it can st least transfer over in some degree of skill


[4/26/2022 7:27 PM] Deleted User

titties


[4/26/2022 7:27 PM] Deleted User
That‚Äôs right


[4/26/2022 7:28 PM] say_grr
It wouldn't be that hard.  It's basically the same as RL cars with the physics until you add lean for turns if you do?  Even that, you can control the lean to avoid tipping while on the ground.


[4/26/2022 7:28 PM] Deleted User
Rl is a new experience for anyone

my update is done


[4/26/2022 7:28 PM] Deleted User
because it‚Äôs more to it then just ‚Äòcar soccer‚Äô


[4/26/2022 7:28 PM] trevlovespizza
Absolutely. But I don‚Äôt see a car soccer/hockey type game being bigger than RL while RL is still on the market (unless they fuck up huge)


[4/26/2022 7:29 PM] say_grr
Probably not soccar, but something similar with a ball and goal using vehicles


[4/26/2022 7:29 PM] say_grr
It doesn't even have to be vehicles.  there will be another sports game with this type of "gameplay".  Easy to pick up, hard to master


[4/26/2022 7:30 PM] trevlovespizza
I mean, make a physics based Quidditch game that isn‚Äôt full of mictrotransactions and that would 100% compete with RL.


[4/26/2022 7:30 PM] trevlovespizza
Fuck, even have microtransactions and it still would I think


[4/26/2022 7:30 PM] Deleted User
Someone just has to do it and succeed with it like psyonix did


[4/26/2022 7:31 PM] say_grr
I could see a space themed sports game with zero gravity inside courts similar to rocket league


[4/26/2022 7:31 PM] trevlovespizza
Look at that knockout game. Similar open concept. Never took off though


[4/26/2022 7:31 PM] say_grr
Yeah, but knockout wasn't coded well.  The gameplay mechanics were horrible


[4/26/2022 7:32 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, another EA published game they just cared about making money off microtransactions


[4/26/2022 7:32 PM] Deleted User
EA is becoming so sad


[4/26/2022 7:33 PM] trevlovespizza
So many developers are. It‚Äôs very sad state of video games. We‚Äôll still always get great games, but so many are just cash grabs


[4/26/2022 7:33 PM] say_grr
They are all becoming so sad......  It's the indy developers that will put out the "next" rocket league type game


[4/26/2022 7:33 PM] say_grr
It's not something you can market.  It's something that comes from testing things out until something just clicks


[4/26/2022 7:34 PM] Deleted User
Video games are so popular rn, if it‚Äôs enough, it‚Äôll get attention for money


[4/26/2022 7:34 PM] Deleted User
and they have so many micro transactions where they‚Äôll make even more


[4/26/2022 7:34 PM] Deleted User
esp off little kids, because of they‚Äôre parents


[4/26/2022 7:36 PM] trevlovespizza
100%


[4/26/2022 7:36 PM] say_grr
I don't mind microtransactions if they don't interfere with the bases gameplay.  Pay to win sucks.  RL has it better by not having any option to pay to win


[4/26/2022 7:37 PM] trevlovespizza
I don‚Äôt care about microtransactions. 
If it doesn‚Äôt give unfair advantages to online multiplayer, it doesn‚Äôt bother me. Fuck pay2play. 

I don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs microtransactions in single player games that help the player beat the game easier/different skins because it‚Äôs not required


[4/26/2022 7:37 PM] trevlovespizza
@Grr8-_-Ness ayy we had the same thought lol


[4/26/2022 7:37 PM] say_grr
microtransactions make it possible to have free to play games and still pay for the servers and everything else

So far, they are keeping the pay stuff to cosmetics and there is no added abilities to certain players so there will be no pay to win which is nice.

Can this BOT actually BEAT Grand Champions in Rocket League?
Rocket League Bots are getting good....really good. Just a couple months ago I showed off Necto, the champion-level machine learning bot that had taught itself to play Rocket League. Well custom AI in Rocket League seems to be a fast paced business because we are already back with Necto Version 2 or Nexto. Nexto has put in over 200 thousand hour...

Either way, team Queso plan on staying an EU org, or they‚Äôd just lose their RLCS points for Worlds this season. There were rumors that teams (specifically Envy) were looking to poach Rise. from Queso with a huge contract, but Rise. rejected it

i made an alt to see where i can get my self. want to see where i truly land


[4/29/2022 3:40 PM] icybutmelting
I think 2s for what u want, then. The more ppl on the field, the less control you have over the outcome of the game


[4/29/2022 4:01 PM] hoglishva
i've learned i cant 1v2 silvers :'(


[4/29/2022 4:16 PM] hoglishva
Damn there's at least one person afk every other game


[4/29/2022 4:17 PM] icybutmelting
When 1v2ing, it‚Äôs mostly waiting for opportunities, similar to 1v1. You could probably just wait in net for ppl to overcommit all the way to plat


[4/29/2022 4:18 PM] icybutmelting

[5/4/2022 12:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
no it was like a usb thing where i just have to plug it in. If u take that usb part off, theres some metal prongs that attach to the usb plug part. One of the prongs fell out. I fixed it though and it still works.


[5/4/2022 12:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
And i just glued the thing back on using a soldering iron and a glue stick

I'm down to play some 2's though if you want.  I've already dropped the unranked mmr on this alt to below 1,000.  Casual 2's should be a breeze and the other team will probably be the one forfeiting

and then i thought of that joke


[5/5/2022 4:27 PM] hoglishva
what problem?


[5/5/2022 4:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it was a multiple choice question, but it asked,"Which one of the following quadratic equations has x=5 over 6 as the unique solution?" and then it gave a bunch of ax^2+bx+c=0 equations


[5/5/2022 4:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
the ^is the squared thing if u didnt know


[5/5/2022 4:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

i got some boost confidence, the last 1V1 a do was against a GC1~2 in 1S and got so destroy (like 12-3) that was the moment s embarrasing RL moments in my lfe


[5/5/2022 9:59 PM] icybutmelting
Just 1 game doesnt say everything tbh. We literally traded two games of 5 goal blowouts lol

Former team Queso members (rise., joyo, and vatira) are officially signed to Moist Esports (under Moist Critikal aka pengiunz0 aka Charlie). Rizzo is also signed as a content creator for them


[5/6/2022 10:50 AM] .brysn
sucha  waste of talent


[5/6/2022 10:50 AM] icybutmelting
Also, XSet signed Evoh (most talented free agent in NA) before he turned 15 (minimum age to play in RLCS). Evoh was considered Daniel‚Äôs rival in the 1v1 scene btw


[5/6/2022 10:50 AM] .brysn
shoulda got signed to a way bigger orgh

[5/6/2022 10:51 AM] .brysn
it woulda been crazy if they were the new C9 rl team


[5/6/2022 10:52 AM] icybutmelting
Cap. EU orgs barely pay their players, and Moist has super high potential to be a big brand bc of critikal‚Äôs large, cult-like fanbase


[5/6/2022 10:53 AM] .brysn
ik but imagine c9 has a comeback story and they win the first major back or something


[5/6/2022 10:53 AM] icybutmelting
Him alone caused Rizzo to have the highest record for a RL content creator stream (even bearing Sunless‚Äôs 24 hour stream thing lol)


[5/6/2022 10:54 AM] icybutmelting
Yeah sure, but I completely see why ex-Queso signed with moist. Wasn‚Äôt a waste of talent imo

Will vc be cross-platform? or do we not know yet


[5/6/2022 5:25 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes, cross-platform. 

No VC to opposing teams. 
Only in in-game parties or in-game with teammates


[5/6/2022 5:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
can we talk to the opp. teamif we want to?


[5/6/2022 5:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or is it not possible


[5/6/2022 5:26 PM] nebula1157
I am excited and nervous about this,
Excited comms with tm8s in ranked.
Nervous, unlike VC on Fortnite, If you lose, you are out  and both go Different ways, but in RL, a couple of goals could be losing and people can't leave or they get banned


[5/6/2022 5:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like saying," Hey, orange team yall suck ** * " for example.


[5/6/2022 5:27 PM] trevlovespizza
No, as of right now there‚Äôs no plan on adding vc to the opposing team. 

Which I think is good. 

It should be used for comming with randoms. It‚Äôs going to make solo queuing a lot better. Yeah, there‚Äôs going to be toxic people but it won‚Äôt all be bad.


[5/6/2022 5:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
oh ok. üò¶


[5/6/2022 5:29 PM] trevlovespizza
If it was full open vc in-game, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to comm without the opponent hearing all of it and vice-versa. Unless they added it during goal replays and post game, but that will be incredibly toxic I think.


[5/6/2022 5:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i mean isnt there an option to turn team chat on or off?


[5/6/2022 5:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i dont see it in the article btw


[5/6/2022 5:31 PM] nebula1157
When VC is a thing, what's the point of Quick Chat


[5/6/2022 5:32 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes, for text, but I don‚Äôt think that would work quite the same. There‚Äôs no need to talk to the opponents mid-game unless you‚Äôre being toxic. 

Say you‚Äôre playing with randoms. 

You have the ball, the opponent says on your left, you think it‚Äôs your teammate as obviously I doubt you‚Äôll know all their voices.


[5/6/2022 5:32 PM] nebula1157
unless they can't talk


[5/6/2022 5:32 PM] icybutmelting

[5/6/2022 5:34 PM] nebula1157
I agree, what epic and Psyonix have been doing lately is amazing


[5/6/2022 5:34 PM] trevlovespizza
I think because each platform has their own moderation system and they just haven‚Äôt updated it since U3. I think eventually once U5 is out, I could see it getting full cross

Either their club name abbreviations are profane (and therefore censored), or it's just another RL glitch lol

oh, i thought d1 was censored lol;


[5/8/2022 9:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it could also just actually be their team name


[5/8/2022 9:52 PM] icybutmelting
Back when I was in gold and playing with cousins, my club name used to be Clappin Cheeks (abv: [BUTT]) and it was censored in game lol

@everyone I will be hosting a Jeopardy game tomorrow night @7:00. I Suggest everyone arrive a little early. I will be hosting and the Game will most likely be teams of 2, which I will decide tomorrow before the game. Please react with this emote to say if you are going to be there.

Note: reacting will give me a general idea of how many will be there, the number can change.

I hope everyone that can will be there to have fun. I will see you there!

I feel you guys play to your opponents skill level, you know?


[5/16/2022 7:10 PM] icybutmelting
true... the game ends up being chaotic so we never really take any possession. it ends up being boomer ball and 50s everywhere


[5/16/2022 7:11 PM] trevlovespizza
100% understand that. With higher skilled gameplay, you don‚Äôt expect a lot of whiffs and them playing a certain way, so when you play other skill levels and they‚Äôre missing and double committing, etc, it really throws off your play style and how you approach the game. I hate that


[5/16/2022 7:13 PM] icybutmelting
Either way, Elden Ring time!


[5/16/2022 7:13 PM] trevlovespizza

Hey guys, I am wondering is someone here good with cars and willing to help me out? I am looking for some new speakers and a new sterio I am able to install into my car.


[5/18/2022 4:46 PM] lt_milkshake
I‚Äôm good with cars, but not in the audio department


[5/18/2022 4:47 PM] say_grr
You just need to look up the cars stereo and speaker dimensions.  Write them down.  Then when looking for the equipment, make sure they are that size or smaller with the ability to use conversion kits.


[5/18/2022 4:49 PM] say_grr
Most stereo layouts are simple single or double din, but make sure you have the depth as well.  some of those single din stereo's are long and might not fit or leave you crushing your wire harness trying to install it.


[5/18/2022 4:51 PM] nebula1157
ok


[5/18/2022 4:51 PM] nebula1157
thanks man


[5/18/2022 4:53 PM] say_grr
I've replaced dozens of stereo's for myself and friends, along with building quite a few speaker boxes for subs.  Before you pull the trigger, hit me up.  There's other things like the wattage you'll want to watch out for.  You don't want to overload your speakers.

In general. He‚Äôs an amazing caster though

i can agree with that


[5/19/2022 4:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i would think being a 1s caster he would know all the tricks there are to 1v1ing


[5/19/2022 4:35 PM] icybutmelting
Knowing what to do and how to apply it are two completely different things. All of his experience is with watching RL, not playing it


[5/19/2022 4:35 PM] atreebranch3
agreed


[5/19/2022 4:35 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

I was just about to pass out for the night when this happened.  Ended up staying up all night after this stressful event!  We were using an old door to keep the kittens in the kitchen overnight so they aren't running around the house.  In the end, I cut out a large hole above the kitten then cut the solid wood around the hole with care.  Got the kitten out without any injury, just a lot of stress for both the kitten and us!

how she even fit her head in that hole?


[5/20/2022 4:25 PM] say_grr
A lot of that space is hair......  Cats ears fold back while pushing through the hole, but can't fold forward to do the reverse.  I tried pushing the ears down and pushing her head back through, but the ears kept getting stuck.

Guild can't get it out of their backfield


[5/21/2022 12:05 PM] say_grr
I felt that last night a couple matches


[5/21/2022 12:06 PM] say_grr
Beat with chaos!


[5/21/2022 12:16 PM] say_grr
Freefall goal by EEKSO with a held flip after getting bumped.......  INSANE!


[5/21/2022 1:12 PM] lt_milkshake
Moist was not them selves that series


[5/21/2022 1:13 PM] say_grr
Not at all, they got destroyed

[5/21/2022 1:58 PM] icybutmelting
Can‚Äôt believe liquid held moist to 0 goals in all 4 games‚Ä¶ oski is just better


[5/21/2022 2:08 PM] say_grr
What a Grr8-_-Ness goal


[5/21/2022 2:09 PM] say_grr
Not EEKSO, but that final goal by Moon.  Demo shot redirected into goal by defender


[5/21/2022 2:23 PM] lt_milkshake
Let‚Äôs see if moist gets their form back against endpoint


[5/21/2022 2:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yep


[5/21/2022 2:24 PM] say_grr
Unfortunately, endpoint is playing just as well as they did last series


[5/21/2022 2:26 PM] say_grr
They're not giving moist any room


[5/21/2022 2:46 PM] say_grr
Is Moist getting swept AGAIN?


[5/21/2022 3:04 PM] lt_milkshake
C‚ÄôMON MOIST


[5/21/2022 3:14 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

Close, but make it 20 years instead of 7 months


[5/22/2022 10:09 AM] say_grr
At least with gas there was a dip.  My skills prevented taht, lol


[5/22/2022 10:09 AM] nebula1157
No way! You made it rank 4.2


[5/22/2022 10:10 AM] nebula1157

I‚Äôm so jealous


[5/22/2022 10:11 AM] say_grr
It's crazy how good those private corporations are at setting prices high when there are people in power they don't want in power!


[5/22/2022 10:12 AM] say_grr
They are able to control the minds of voters as they blame anyone that will tax them and shorten their profit margin.


[5/22/2022 10:12 AM] say_grr
They gouged the crap out of us under Obama cause they really hated him.  Now it's Biden


[5/22/2022 10:19 AM] say_grr
Here's that actual Crude oil prices that should directly determine the gas prices.  Crude oil was higher in 1980 and 50% higher under Obama than it is today, yet prices are higher today........  Any takers on who is to blame for the price of gas?

BDS in the finals, what a surprise!


[5/22/2022 11:46 AM] lt_milkshake
I mean they‚Äôve been the most consistently good eu team for a while


[5/22/2022 12:38 PM] say_grr
What a shot to finish that game with 0 to save themselves from elimination


[5/22/2022 12:38 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, I feel like ot would have ended with k corp winning


[5/22/2022 12:39 PM] say_grr
But I don't think they'll have enough to put Karmine down

Lmao


[5/22/2022 12:52 PM] say_grr
And they finally held them off


[5/22/2022 12:52 PM] say_grr
Once they got that goal lead, it was straight no overcommit defense

Looks like BDS making this a one series grand final

Yeah


[5/22/2022 2:41 PM] say_grr
Unless they be popping some crazy enhancement drugs during this timeout, I'm calling it for BDS!


[5/22/2022 2:42 PM] say_grr
I need it to stretch a little while though.  I'm at 81% for the last gift this week.


[5/22/2022 2:52 PM] say_grr
Doubt it gonna last another 36 minutes.....


[5/22/2022 2:53 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah


[5/22/2022 2:57 PM] say_grr
It's because BDS cuts a LOT!  Closest to the ball almost always goes


[5/22/2022 2:57 PM] say_grr
That's why others fail to be able to play that playstyle


[5/22/2022 2:58 PM] say_grr
It throws off defensive rotations


[5/22/2022 5:07 PM] say_grr
In the finals HOOPS!


[5/22/2022 5:39 PM] say_grr
BOOOOOO.  Lost in the finals, game 3, by one goal!


[5/22/2022 5:53 PM] icybutmelting
That‚Äôs so pain.


[5/22/2022 5:54 PM] icybutmelting
The French comms, their supreme skill with powersliding to get actually great clears/soft touches, and also mechanical skill after the cut to beat defenders all make that idea possible lol

I don‚Äôt care about the rewards either, but it‚Äôd be nice to have atleast SOMETHING that looks good to show off the hard work of getting the rewards


[5/24/2022 4:42 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah but...


[5/24/2022 4:43 PM] lt_milkshake
But what?


[5/24/2022 4:43 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
anything is better than nothing


[5/24/2022 4:43 PM] trevlovespizza
Like?


[5/24/2022 4:43 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Though at this point it feels like they are mocking to comunity


[5/24/2022 4:44 PM] trevlovespizza
We just had a GE. Wheels are hit or miss. Rarely no one uses antennas or toppers. That leaves banners as the only option that would be okay. And that‚Äôs if they make it decent like the dragon ones way back


[5/24/2022 4:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i want a dragon one


[5/24/2022 4:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
more ge would be nice


[5/24/2022 4:48 PM] trevlovespizza
B2B GE is a bad idea. 

I only want a GE if they have a new one similar to Cosmosis/Shade Raid


[5/24/2022 4:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
well the decals are fine


[5/24/2022 4:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i still use them unlike other stuff


[5/24/2022 4:49 PM] lt_milkshake
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a decal IF IT WASNT THE SAME THING THE PAST 3 TIMES and the new one too

bro


[5/24/2022 4:52 PM] trevlovespizza
I mean, there‚Äôs only so many different options for reward decals. 

S1 and this season isn‚Äôt comparable. 

These still look different enough. Especially when 80% people will use them for two weeks and then no one cares anymore


[5/24/2022 4:52 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, no one cares cuz they‚Äôre not great


[5/24/2022 4:52 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
no i still use them


[5/24/2022 4:52 PM] icybutmelting
The S12 one looks so cool tho‚Ä¶ I wish I was playing RL back then tbh


[5/24/2022 4:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[5/24/2022 4:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[5/24/2022 5:01 PM] icybutmelting
I kinda want avatar borders/banners, a new trail, antennas (which aren‚Äôt as bad as toppers imo), or hopefully some combination of them in 1 season. I think I genuinely would‚Äôve liked the wheels if they used regular tire treads instead of that spiky bs

There's a lot of guys in here that might be able to help you get over that hump.   You've still got a little time to finish it.  I'm better at 3's than 2's but if you're a strong diamond, even I can help you with that.

Cities Skylines is now available at HumbleBundle with all DLC, minus the newest Airports expansion(but you get a 20% coupon with the bundle, not a $20 off[MY BAD]).  I have it with all the expansions for the PS, but the PC version is better with MODS to help handle traffic!  Picking that one up!

I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I don‚Äôt deserve to be champ‚Ä¶


[5/30/2022 3:30 AM] lt_milkshake
Don‚Äôt say that, you put in all that work to get to champ. You deserve to be there


[5/30/2022 4:34 AM] trevlovespizza
Absolutely you deserve it. And you‚Äôll drop from champ and be in diamond again 100%. Everyone does it no matter their rank. They don‚Äôt permanently peak. We all hover and have off games. Just gotta keep grinding so your floor is champ and you‚Äôre consistently there. Next season just keep practicing and improving and push for C2. Eventually you‚Äôll be completely out of diamond


[5/30/2022 8:27 AM] otassin
Yup i pay somes artist for it and m proud of it, i have a lot of things i want to change so be ready :3


[5/30/2022 8:36 AM] otassin
there a things no one not even you can say that because there millions of players and each are differents, number of hours differents, gameplay differents, rotate differents, number of hours played per days differents, mentality differents etc... whats is a champ, a ranks ? Just some points, exacty like in game, your points doesnt really mean anythings


[5/30/2022 8:44 AM] otassin
If you miss your action don't act like your just bad, instead ask yourself why do i miss ? because i didn't turn enought, or did i turn too much ? Do i jump too close a too far from the ball ? did i pay attention at the enemy enough before challenging ? Did i go for the right mecanics for beating the enemy ? people miss way more than you thinks, even if i end up beating the player what do i do next ? etc... for me every touchs that doesnt end up with a goal a still having the control of the ball can be considere as a missplay


[5/30/2022 11:34 AM] otassin
@DG iCy i remember that you or someone else ask about my name "otassin" no it doesn't mean anything in french it's just a fusion between my 1st pseudo made by my brother (Last-SkyAssassin) and the word "Otaku" because i love anime Otaku + Assassin = Otassin

[5/30/2022 6:39 PM] mischixvous
I don‚Äôt understand what i do wrong though that‚Äôs the problem. I don‚Äôt mean I do everything perfectly‚Ä¶ very far from it but i just don‚Äôt know where to look for improvement.


[5/30/2022 6:45 PM] otassin

[5/30/2022 6:55 PM] icybutmelting
@Mischief are you on PC or PSN?


[5/30/2022 6:55 PM] otassin
what would be easier for me is that you take a video of the entire game from your point of view @Mischief


[5/30/2022 6:55 PM] icybutmelting
if you are on PC or PS5, we can do a replay analysis without the need of making a video

Come join us in a private t‚Äôs fun and good practice!


[5/30/2022 8:00 PM] mischixvous
got 6 wins into champ


[5/30/2022 8:00 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
just play with us


[5/30/2022 8:00 PM] mischixvous
then lost 9


[5/30/2022 8:00 PM] mischixvous
BECAUSE OF FUCKING RETARDS ON MY TEAM JUST LIKE DIAMOND

hopefully champ is better next


[5/30/2022 8:13 PM] mischixvous
with the morons getting knocked out of it


[5/30/2022 8:14 PM] trevlovespizza
Just play casual and practice and forget about comp


[5/30/2022 8:19 PM] lt_milkshake
Unfortunately, it only gets more ballchasey in c2


[5/30/2022 8:19 PM] icybutmelting
@Mischief if u rly want the rewards, I can literally 1v2 to c1. Multiple others can and will carry u


[5/30/2022 8:19 PM] trevlovespizza
See I think it‚Äôs gets way less ball chasey in c2. I normally don‚Äôt have an issue with that with solo queues


[5/30/2022 8:19 PM] icybutmelting
But Trev is right, just continue to play the game and you will continue to improve


[5/30/2022 8:20 PM] icybutmelting
I'll do replay analysis anytime with u bro!


[5/30/2022 8:22 PM] otassin
@Mischief your too much focus on your ranks and winning, if you really want to be better it take a LOT of times, you need to work on your patience and play a lot of training and analyst your own replays, you don't care  about your m8 you need to adapt yourself to them


[5/30/2022 8:23 PM] mischixvous
i have rewards, im just pissed that its basically just diamond but faster


[5/30/2022 8:23 PM] mischixvous
if they know how to hit it thats even better


[5/30/2022 8:23 PM] lt_milkshake
They don‚Äôt


[5/30/2022 8:24 PM] lt_milkshake
It may just be that my main duo‚Äôs partner feels out making me have to ball chase a bit that makes it feel more ballchasey tho


[5/30/2022 8:25 PM] lt_milkshake
Hell, I‚Äôd even help, I‚Äôm not as good as the other guys but I‚Äôm right around c1/c2 rn myself

[5/30/2022 8:26 PM] mischixvous
LOL


[5/30/2022 8:26 PM] otassin
adapt yourself to them, they ballchase ? use that at your advantage and play more slowly etc.. if it's really impossible grind with someone whos your lvl and that you like playing with !


[5/30/2022 8:26 PM] mischixvous
my casual mmr is like silver level


[5/30/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

Or private games. Everyone that‚Äôs joined the Buds has greatly improved. Not being cocky with the server, but we‚Äôre good at helping eachother and improving gameplay. Play against Grr8 and you‚Äôll soon figure out how to play against fast gameplay. We‚Äôre always down to help


[5/30/2022 8:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah even bot has gotten so much better just by playing with us

[5/30/2022 8:28 PM] otassin
@Mischief  well if you want to be better don't expect to be like you see "lvl up" on your screen, it take so many times liek years to be comfortable with your gameplay


[5/30/2022 8:29 PM] trevlovespizza
@Otassin. used to be only a lowly Silver 3 before I carried him to Champ 3 in the last week. üòâ


[5/30/2022 8:29 PM] trevlovespizza
Hog has put the hours in, he‚Äôs improved so much it‚Äôs insane


[5/30/2022 8:29 PM] otassin
he was pulling some triple reset, and now i took hes gameplay, that the truth lmao


[5/30/2022 8:30 PM] lt_milkshake
I disagree with this


[5/30/2022 8:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah this isnt an isekai ||an anime genre where the MC (main Character) is summoned or reincarnated into another world where ususally there is a llvl system||


[5/30/2022 8:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think i summed that up right


[5/30/2022 8:30 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah! It‚Äôs some space jam shit. He stole my talent


[5/30/2022 8:30 PM] otassin

On the conversation of ramen, I HIGHLY recommend these. The beef & lime and barbeque chicken where my favorite.  some of them are suppose to be cooked like ramen, some there isnt suppose to be broth.

Take a break for a week or something. That‚Äôs what I do when everything in RL makes me mad. Im easily irritable those times and breaks help for sure to get your mind right and get some composure.


[6/1/2022 11:30 PM] icybutmelting
Hunter, none of us are accredited psychologists/therapists, but what I will say is that everything starts with you. Rocket league is just a video game, but it‚Äôs also a really good analogy for life itself. From in game mechanics, to school grades, to finances, etc‚Ä¶ some ppl may be naturally gifted and have an inherent advantage, sure‚Ä¶ but hard work/effort (the behavioral approach) and a good mindset (the cognitive approach) can really make huge differences

You can really do a vast majority of the things you put your mind to if you believe in yourself enough, and if you try hard enough.


[6/1/2022 11:31 PM] icybutmelting
Believing in yourself is the first step bro. You got this, whatever ‚Äúthis‚Äù may be

Although... This could be apart of his evil plot to control others. He starts with a small discord server which gradually will get bigger. And he cultivates friendships with those in the server. Until sooner or later they develop a need for him. They want his attention, and want to be around him. Until finally he controls all the people in the world and he has world domination!

Or... Even though hes on a computer we can still feel his energy/good vibes, and we want to vibe even more. 

Or... He's just a really fun person to hang out with. And so we want to have more fun with him. 

OR... come up with ur own ideas.

[6/4/2022 3:09 AM] trevlovespizza
@Mischief not at all dude. 
I got like 1000 followers and was averaging close to 50 viewers a stream and I was only D2. You just gotta be a bit charismatic and really interact with the viewers. Rank helps for sure, but it‚Äôs not everything - my first month I had 1-2 viewers and it was rough but if you keep grinding it, you‚Äôll be fine. You just need to put out a good product


[6/4/2022 3:42 AM] mischixvous
Yeah i don‚Äôt know how to be charismatic


[6/4/2022 3:56 AM] mischixvous
And I also wouldn‚Äôt be successful because I don‚Äôt have the set up for it


[6/4/2022 3:56 AM] mischixvous

Dude, I streamed from PlayStation so I had no extras or overlays or anything. You can do this


[6/4/2022 4:23 AM] mischixvous
I tried streaming before but never really got the whole advertising my stream part‚Ä¶ it took the fun out of it for me.


[6/4/2022 4:24 AM] mischixvous
Since that was more of my time than actually streaming or playing


[6/4/2022 4:31 AM] trevlovespizza
Just like any other business, you have to market yourself. Eventually you won‚Äôt have to after you get a small following and can focus more on the content. Like I told you earlier, I‚Äôm kind of great with marketing - get it all set up and I can help you with that.


[6/4/2022 4:37 AM] mischixvous
I mean i think it‚Äôs basically all set up i just don‚Äôt have overlays and whatnot


[6/4/2022 6:07 AM] trevlovespizza
@Mischief 
Yeah, get overlays. Get a bot set up to let viewers interact with things while you stream. Make it fun for them. 

Be innovative a bit. 
 I had a command on twitch that if something did (I think) !RandomCar - It would auto generate a full RL car (decal, topper, etc) and I‚Äôd have to use it for the next hour or whatever. 

So things like that. Make it more interactive - that‚Äôs your best bet


[6/4/2022 9:46 AM] mischixvous
Yeah see i can‚Äôt do the random car i stg i have a certain car i do well with that day


[6/4/2022 10:54 AM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôm the end, ‚Äújust keep trying and don‚Äôt give up,‚Äù is an extremely common factor with successful streamers. You‚Äôve also received some really solid and specific advice that you shouldn‚Äôt knock until you try. There‚Äôs a litany of advice online too


[6/4/2022 10:54 AM] icybutmelting
If u post ur stuff in the twitch channels chat, a lot of us will give u a follow!


[6/4/2022 10:55 AM] icybutmelting
In the end, it‚Äôs only gonna work if u want it to (and *will* it to)


[6/4/2022 10:56 AM] icybutmelting
Ngl I‚Äôm way too lazy and inconsistent with time to ever wanna stream. Shoutout to y‚Äôall on that grind!


[6/4/2022 11:00 AM] say_grr
RESEARCH!!!  There are a few youtube videos from streamers about what "works" and what doesn't.  What works for them might not work for you, but it would give you an idea of how to create a UNIQUE stream that people are willing to watch over all the other streams.  It's not just going to happen overnight unless you get extremely lucky(Hardly ever happens) and you already have the other parts done.

[6/4/2022 11:47 AM] say_grr
In game you have to read the ball and the position of the opponent along with knowing whether or not that opponent has the boost to do damage


[6/4/2022 11:47 AM] icybutmelting
If you jump early and twerk mid-air to get the ball, you‚Äôre not training anything


[6/4/2022 11:47 AM] icybutmelting
Also focus on hitting the ball to the corners where someone can‚Äôt just take an immediate shot. Also focus on landing your car straight after a save

It's takes a minute to figure out in game, with necto you have an advantage cause he flicks a lot.  Once you figure out the "code" of maintaining the same speed as the ball along with being able to speed up for a banger of a flick, you'll understand shadowing efficiently.


[6/4/2022 11:51 AM] say_grr
I still don't have it down perfectly as I'll miss the banger flicks sometimes.  But until you hit GC, those will be few and far in between in matches.  You'll get flicked on, but not always with the most power.


[6/4/2022 11:53 AM] say_grr
I use the Musty Flick training pack to practice my flicks.  Don't pick the ball up straight, hit it at an angle then take control and flick however you want to score.

How?


[6/4/2022 7:02 PM] nebula1157
I started with 1650. I purchased the pass for 1000 and this puts me at 650. I made it to tier 112, earning me 1100. but my total is 1450? how does that make sense


[6/4/2022 7:02 PM] nebula1157
It should be 1750 right


[6/4/2022 7:02 PM] say_grr
You only earn 1,000, but you're still off

I can't believe I was thinking it was operator error for a few days before I realized it was the controller preventing me from quick turning to the right.  Here's the site in case anyone else wants to check it out.  https://halfwaydead.gitlab.io/rl-deadzone/

[6/6/2022 11:33 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think this happened because of a spelling bee i did at maybe 4 or 5 yrs of age. What happened was i messed up the easiest word ever, and i was so devastated, that now i just cant stand not knowing or seeing the right spelling of a word. Btw the word was "ONLY"

Binary has only 2 options, 1 and 0.  Morse code has 3 options, a short burst, long burst and silence.  You need binary for programming, but don't really code in 1 and 0's......  You need morse code for military and survival of "The end of days".

You can see from that image there, it has 2 parts that make the connection and the stick just spins it around in a circle to move the connection.  Stick drift is just something inside making a connection it's not supposed to be making.  Cleaning fixes most stick drift unless there is spring issues


[6/6/2022 3:10 PM] say_grr
The little metal and plastic disc on the bottom of the second picture and the inside of the orange part that is open is the areas that need cleaning.  Sometimes with the metal disc, you can pull up on the metal tab to make a better connection, but be careful, you don't want to move it while doing it or your deadzone will move!  Or you can just donate them to me and I'll fix them and never have to buy another controller!

No need for an extra vehicle when going to the lake or camping.  Your minivan can tow the boat or the trailer.


[6/8/2022 1:34 AM] lt_milkshake
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad thing


[6/8/2022 1:34 AM] say_grr
For families that do that a lot, they always have to bring 2 vehicles.  A truck to carry the equipment, and a minivan to carry the fam.


[6/8/2022 1:34 AM] lt_milkshake
I personally find if fucking stupid in all the right ways


[6/8/2022 1:35 AM] say_grr
It's crazy, but crazy necessary in some situations.  Like throwing a jet engine in a semi truck.  Sometimes you need to just get down the road quick!

I'm not downloading them, just activating them from the steam key.  It took less than an hour to start beck up and I've got most of them done.  Last Bundle is the Ukranian Bundle!  Lots of games in this one!

Apparently there‚Äôs a statistic that 30-35% of all of the internet is explicit p0rnographic content. I know all of the meme ones bc of public school banter. In general, avoid going directly to websites. Just google them without the .com first lol


[6/12/2022 4:25 PM] hoglishva

[6/12/2022 4:26 PM] icybutmelting
The most famous troll link (bc it sounds so safe) is whitehouse . com. Also very nsfw

[6/12/2022 4:28 PM] icybutmelting
More like just google the website without the ‚Äú.com‚Äù

More general internet advice, do not ever put any information in websites that don‚Äôt start with ‚Äúhttps‚Äù (the s is extremely important) @.J


[6/12/2022 4:29 PM] birch0001
In general don‚Äôt even https sells your information


[6/12/2022 4:30 PM] hoglishva
the S is for secure, using end to end encryption so its safe to type a password

like no thrid parties can look at what youre typing


[6/12/2022 4:31 PM] hoglishva
what that website does with it though depends


[6/12/2022 4:31 PM] hoglishva
Might be the ISP youre thinking of as well


[6/12/2022 4:33 PM] icybutmelting
Nothing that will actually lead to you either getting viruses/malware or criminal activity (like identity theft). But for targeted advertisements and such, yes (never passwords or actual personal identifiable info, just habits, search terms, etc.). It‚Äôs basically unavoidable

Not all of it, but some of it for sure. Psyonix hired Cinderblock, one of the Bakkes devs a while back and they‚Äôve been having him bring it over. I believe it started with the free play update

[6/15/2022 2:59 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
CULT : a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.

CLAN : a group of people with a strong common interest.

Seeing as like 30% of users don‚Äôt get past the tutorial, there‚Äôs a small point to this. But if you‚Äôre a true gamer and ‚Äúgit gud,‚Äù it‚Äôs the most rewarding and rich gaming experience of all time

@Brysn thinks that rumble is at least 40% luck/rng. Can someone tell him it is about 20%?


[6/17/2022 5:56 PM] .brysn
Def not only 20%


[6/17/2022 5:57 PM] trevlovespizza
There‚Äôs a lot of skill involved in rumble, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to put an actual number on it.


[6/17/2022 5:58 PM] nebula1157
That‚Äôs fair

[6/17/2022 6:17 PM] nebula1157
Lol fax


[6/17/2022 6:20 PM] icybutmelting
Not possible to put a statistic/number on a correlational opinion. The ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù of a rumble game is different from the outcome of obtaining a rumble power-up. You could say there‚Äôs a 25% chance (I made that number up) you get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or meta power-up. It‚Äôs similar to getting a 25% chance you get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù card in your starting poker hand (J, Q, K, A)


[6/17/2022 6:21 PM] icybutmelting
However, in both poker and rumble, what you do with that hand involves skill and strategy, especially if others involved at the game are also skilled


[6/17/2022 6:21 PM] icybutmelting
Someone with a bad power-up or a bad hand will still absolutely destroy a noob


[6/17/2022 6:22 PM] icybutmelting
In conclusion, I hate both poker and rumble

[6/19/2022 11:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
nevermind, i see i have to reach gc2


[6/19/2022 11:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or higher than ur peak


[6/20/2022 1:11 AM] icybutmelting
Probably the day you switch to PC ngl


[6/20/2022 1:12 AM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôm 75% sure ur instantly gonna be above 1600 lol


[6/20/2022 1:16 AM] hoglishva
I do wonder how dumbed down the switch graphics are or just how bad it runs so it looks okay.


[6/20/2022 7:34 AM] icybutmelting
The switch when docked and connected to a monitor can only run a max of 1080p on 30fps with an average of 25 ms input lag (2-3 frames)


[6/20/2022 7:36 AM] icybutmelting
That‚Äôs not even taking into account the lack of processing speed and wifi connectivity. All of that is unbelievably noticeable when playing a game like rocket league, especially the nasty input delay.


[6/20/2022 7:36 AM] icybutmelting
I would bet money Jay could easily hit gc2 in a couple days on my set up lol

If the tw octane came into the shop how much do u think they would sell it for?


[6/25/2022 3:58 PM] say_grr
The same price as every other painted octane


[6/25/2022 3:58 PM] lt_milkshake
Like 900 or whatever it costs to build a tw import from a bp. They don‚Äôt gaf abt community prices for items they put in the shop. (Ex.Tw fennec)

[6/25/2022 4:19 PM] lt_milkshake
It was just an example, they price all items of the same rarity the same


[6/25/2022 4:22 PM] say_grr
The octane is only on trade-up.  The colored versions of it have been sold on the store before.  I don't remember the price, but whatever that was, it will be the same for the white.


[6/25/2022 4:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
u sure?


[6/25/2022 4:23 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think 800cr for tw octane


[6/25/2022 4:24 PM] say_grr
Yeah.  They don't care about the prices of the trading networks.  They do the same for every car.  I picked up the tw fennec on my alt because it was only 600.  The same price they've put every colored fennec.  They've done that for everything.  Boosts, toppers, etc....


[6/25/2022 4:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i looked at the fennec ones and the painted fennecs are 700 to open an tw is 800cr. They recently put a purple octane in the store at 700cr so im guessing 800cr for the tw one

[6/25/2022 4:31 PM] say_grr
You're right.  I really thought it was the same.  TW is 100 credits more in the shop then other colors.  Now I'm going to have to pay attention to the other things like boost to see if they change the price for tw.


[6/25/2022 4:31 PM] nebula1157
Is there one is the shop?

NO

[6/25/2022 4:32 PM] say_grr

[6/25/2022 4:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
true


[6/25/2022 4:36 PM] lt_milkshake
They do, the amount of price added is different between each rarity, not the item type. So a tw very rare might only have 50 additional where a tw import has 10 added

question. if i reach gc1 in regular comp and get one win in gc, and then play the rest of the matches in rumble, will i still get the title?


[6/25/2022 11:41 PM] capnawesome30
no unless you are GC rumble but then you get a rumble tag but youll get the rewards


[6/25/2022 11:41 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im gc in rumble already


[6/25/2022 11:42 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i just mean if i do part rumble part comp


[6/25/2022 11:42 PM] capnawesome30
then maybe. i dont know if it would give you the normal tag also, you will get rewards and RNG tag


[6/26/2022 9:38 AM] say_grr
Yes, you only need one win in regular comp.  You can get the ten wins in rumble and still get the regular GC title.


[6/26/2022 9:41 AM] say_grr
That's how I got my title last season.  10 wins in rumble at GC level then just one win in ranked 3's at GC level.  I got more than one win in GC, but that didn't really matter.

[6/26/2022 2:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
grr8, i meant. Say, i hv no wins in the gc season reards thingy. Then i hit gc1 in 2s and only do one match. Thats 1/10 wins in gc for the rewards. Then i do the rest in gc rumble. So 1/10 in 2s gc, and 9/10 in rumble gc.

[6/27/2022 1:31 PM] .codyyy
Hopefully it fixed it Icy :(


[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] .codyyy
true


[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] icybutmelting
I scheduled a laptop check up for Friday, so I‚Äôll figure something out there too


[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] icybutmelting
And ty ‚ù§Ô∏è


[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] .codyyy
that‚Äôs good


[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] .codyyy

[6/27/2022 1:32 PM] .codyyy
it‚Äôs irritating, i understand lol


[6/27/2022 1:33 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs exactly what I needed to be a freeplay main XD


[6/27/2022 1:33 PM] .codyyy
i put a new motherboard in my pc and it wouldn‚Äôt work at first and i switched them out like 3 times and i finally figured out why üò≠üò≠


[6/27/2022 1:33 PM] .codyyy
üòÇüòÇüòÇ


[6/27/2022 1:34 PM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôm def the type of person to absolutely fry my motherboard with static while building a pc for the first time


[6/27/2022 1:34 PM] icybutmelting
Glad that wasn‚Äôt the case with u lol


[6/27/2022 1:34 PM] .codyyy
It was my first time, the first time doing it


[6/27/2022 1:35 PM] .codyyy
I just want better ram for right nos


[6/27/2022 1:35 PM] .codyyy
now*


[6/27/2022 1:35 PM] icybutmelting
RAM is the cheapest/easiest thing to switch out on laptops. Is it the same for PC?


[6/27/2022 1:35 PM] .codyyy
I have okay ram but it‚Äôs only 3000 mhz (the speed of the ram)


[6/27/2022 1:35 PM] .codyyy
Depends


[6/27/2022 1:36 PM] .codyyy
Sometimes PSUs are cheapest besides fans


[6/27/2022 1:36 PM] .codyyy
It‚Äôll just depend on how good you get of something


[6/27/2022 1:38 PM] icybutmelting
I switched out my 8gb ram for 32gb, but when I used task manager while running Elden Ring at max settings and a 1080p YouTube vid on google chrome at the same time, I still only reached like 14gb lol


[6/27/2022 1:39 PM] .codyyy
damn lol


[6/27/2022 1:39 PM] .codyyy
I forget how much I use


[6/27/2022 1:39 PM] .codyyy
Cuz i always run at 1440p for games


[6/27/2022 1:39 PM] icybutmelting
16 def seems to be perfectly fine, but I don‚Äôt regret the switch. I‚Äôm sure my processor couldn‚Äôt ever make full use of it


[6/27/2022 1:39 PM] .codyyy
Well, my ram is just a little slower so I wanna up it


[6/27/2022 1:40 PM] .codyyy
and ye prob get like 32gb of like 3600


[6/27/2022 1:40 PM] say_grr
You'll hardly ever use over 16 GB playing any game and running a couple sites.  But for video editing, ram is important.


[6/27/2022 1:40 PM] .codyyy
Listen to this man^


[6/27/2022 1:42 PM] say_grr
Speed does make a difference though.

[6/29/2022 12:31 PM] nebula1157
I‚Äôm sorry but Team Secret Swept BDS?


[6/29/2022 12:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[6/29/2022 12:34 PM] .codyyy
ohh idk them


[6/29/2022 12:34 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs a South American team, along with Furia. They‚Äôre all Brazilian

Bds got slapped


[6/29/2022 1:01 PM] birch0001
They still most likely have the best chance of making it through the lower bracket

[6/29/2022 1:54 PM] icybutmelting
Fun fact, Comm‚Äôs name used to be Communism, and he was known to be hella toxic before he was a pro. Either Psyonix made him change it or he censored himself

[6/29/2022 4:46 PM] icybutmelting
Falcons are 50/50 merchants. I swear most of the game is spent in falcons‚Äôs corner, then they just score easily on the counterattack


[6/29/2022 4:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
JEEZ


[6/29/2022 4:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Faze Sucks?


[6/29/2022 4:47 PM] icybutmelting
Nah, Falcons just look like the best team in the world


[6/29/2022 4:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or Falcons are better


[6/29/2022 4:54 PM] icybutmelting
Retals gets 3x more mechanical during LANs lol


[6/29/2022 4:54 PM] icybutmelting
Unfortunately for SSG, they‚Äôre getting clapped by falcons in front of a crowd on Saturday


[6/29/2022 5:06 PM] icybutmelting

Liquid is a team of extremely mechanical 15ish year olds from Europe. They‚Äôre quite exciting to watch. PWR was the rebranding of Australian team ground zero gaming. They got clapped by liquid


[6/30/2022 12:44 PM] icybutmelting
BDS (supposed best team in Europe) *should* handily win against KC Pioneers (established best team in Australia)‚Ä¶


[6/30/2022 12:44 PM] icybutmelting
But I have a strong feeling BDS somehow lose. If they do, they‚Äôre out of the tournament completely, going out 0-2

Ok, either A. The brackets are just placed fucking horribly unfair or B. All the teams that are expected to do good and the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù teams are just playing like ass


[6/30/2022 1:16 PM] lt_milkshake
Almost every series has been a sweep


[6/30/2022 1:19 PM] icybutmelting

[6/30/2022 1:19 PM] lt_milkshake
Not even just them tho


[6/30/2022 1:19 PM] icybutmelting
BDS had an easy bracket


[6/30/2022 1:19 PM] icybutmelting
They just sucked


[6/30/2022 1:23 PM] lt_milkshake
Furia vs Gladiator, Liquid vs PWR, and Faze vs PWR we‚Äôre all sweeps


[6/30/2022 1:24 PM] lt_milkshake
So either the bracket layout is trash and some of the best teams are facing bottom teams right away, or teams are just flopping HARD


[6/30/2022 1:26 PM] icybutmelting
The best teams are supposed to face the bottom teams right away. No one expected PWR or Gladiator to win a game


[6/30/2022 1:26 PM] .codyyy
The ‚Äòbetter‚Äô teams were supposed to win them, theoretically


[6/30/2022 1:27 PM] icybutmelting
However, no one expected Team Secret (the second team from South America) to sweep BDS, and no one expected KCP to sweep BDS either


[6/30/2022 1:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
in other words it wouldve been unfair for those bottom teams but they pulled through and demolished the top


[6/30/2022 1:27 PM] icybutmelting
BDS just have to accept they‚Äôre not good rn


[6/30/2022 1:27 PM] .codyyy
bds is just bad rn üíÄ i guess

Right now, the best teams in the tourney seem to be SSG, V1, and Falcons. Next tier seems to be Faze, G2, Moist, and Karmine Corp

Either way, Trk511, Beastmode, and Daniel (maybe also Atomic and Firstkiller) are in a league of their own.


[6/30/2022 1:54 PM] lt_milkshake

[7/1/2022 11:29 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Yo Brysn/Slight, its all good. I know its been hot out so being in the pool or just chilling in front of the tv instead of Sweating in RL (pun intended) is what comes to mind


[7/1/2022 11:29 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
That being said, u getting on today?


[7/1/2022 11:35 AM] icybutmelting

Optic Gaming have controllers in they‚Äôre hand during the oasis interview, they‚Äôre still ps4 controllers too


[7/1/2022 12:18 PM] lt_milkshake
I thought more people that use ps4 controllers would‚Äôve switched to ps5 controllers


[7/1/2022 12:19 PM] icybutmelting
I remember from a Lawler vid that the ratio is still 75/25 ps4/ps5 for pros that use PS controllers


[7/1/2022 12:20 PM] lt_milkshake
Oh wow


[7/1/2022 12:20 PM] lt_milkshake

[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i wonder, do they allow controllers with the xtra buttons on the back?


[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] lt_milkshake
Hmm


[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] lt_milkshake
I don‚Äôt see why not


[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] lt_milkshake
Since a lot of the teams are sponsored by scuf


[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] lt_milkshake
Who make pro controllers with paddles on the back


[7/1/2022 12:21 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
scufmaster


[7/1/2022 12:22 PM] icybutmelting
Most use playstation controllers in the states. A few use Xbox. Extra buttons are allowed but extremely rare (idk a single pro that uses them, even with scuf controllers)

[7/1/2022 12:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[7/1/2022 12:22 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, I don‚Äôt feel like paddles are as necessary in rl compared to shooter games


[7/1/2022 12:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Musty needs a shower


[7/1/2022 12:23 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

Did everything I could. I even took it into a computer repair store with a Razer specialist and they found nothing wrong. They professionally cleaned my PC and even replaced the thermal paste themselves. They also did a stress test and said my PC should be able to handle a lot. Paid a couple hundred for that appointment. It's super frustrating.

It's def my cpu. Regardless of when it's idle or in a game, every core randomly dips to 798 MHz (usually at the same time as that core hits a random temperature spike). My temps are ~50 C when idle, 70 C when playing Elden Ring, Borderlands, etc, but ~80 C playing Rocket League. Those processor dips are huge, even though max CPU usage is like 25%

[7/3/2022 9:59 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Means absolutely NOTHING!! Just because he has a gc tourney tag does not mean he is good. Take a look at our own Icy! He's cracked at times but hes also icy. Also ur tm8 is dog, and its because of ur own skill that yall got close to winnning.

Trk drove in reverse in a circle for like 7 whole seconds and falcons still shut out V1. It's not even close


[7/3/2022 11:08 AM] lt_milkshake
I think the main reason falcons are so good is because the major regions don‚Äôt know how to play them yet, I think 1 or 2 more seasons and the other teams will catch up

we literally had bought watermelons and honeydew the day before, and then they turned off the water. We went through about 7-9 gallons of water in 5 days? and on the last day, we ate the watermelon and a little later (like the next day) water came back


[7/5/2022 2:50 PM] .codyyy
sheesh


[7/5/2022 2:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

10 to 12 matches to get all the credits!  This is much easier than grinding the boxes, but 5 boxes is going to be worth more than the 300 credits from this.......

Imagine grinding the boxes, selling them off for 150.  You can get as much as 200 for them easily, but to play it safe......  That would be 1050 credits per account!  If I do all my alts, and add my wife's account along with my son's.....  That's some bank.


[7/7/2022 9:49 AM] say_grr
They really screwed up the casual MMR for this event as well.  Some of my games end with over 50 mmr rewarded to some players.  I've lost over 30 a couple times and won over 30 a few times as well.  These are not new accounts either!  It never gave that much for any casual event in the past!

Let alone was it time for me to be getting off, that last fall guys round was pure AIDS. For some reason there was a massive delay with moving and jumping on the volleyball round and then Nebula decided to not even pass the ball over to me. So if he wasn't going to pass the ball anymore and not let me play why stay?


[7/9/2022 1:08 PM] icybutmelting
Yeah man I got off fall guys early too. It was a bit laggy for me as well


[7/9/2022 1:09 PM] icybutmelting
And getting griefed in that game is not fun for sure. It‚Äôs super frustrating


[7/9/2022 1:10 PM] icybutmelting
I think one of the main sources of fun in RL, fall guys, etc. is the camaraderie you get when playing as a squad‚Ä¶ at the very least, I personally have the most fun doing that

[7/12/2022 4:36 PM] icybutmelting
You can get repeat drops of untradeable titles. It sucks.


[7/12/2022 4:36 PM] hoglishva
This is like, getting champs in a gold lobby EVERY MATCH. How they queue you with other people is insanely bad.

[7/12/2022 4:36 PM] say_grr

[7/12/2022 4:36 PM] icybutmelting
Oh‚Ä¶ nvm not that bad lol


[7/12/2022 4:37 PM] icybutmelting
Nope! You can trade up player anthems (music) though, which is grr8

[7/14/2022 11:55 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and playing on that mindset got me from c2div4 to c3 div 2 with 1mmr off of div3


[7/14/2022 12:00 PM] empanada.s
2s u play like a lil behind the other person, and u can hard challenge if yk ur tm is watching the 50


[7/14/2022 12:00 PM] empanada.s
It‚Äôs a 1v1 with a lot more freedom


[7/14/2022 12:00 PM] empanada.s

[7/14/2022 12:01 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[7/15/2022 6:01 AM] say_grr
Just some more prototyping.  After seeing a game like Rimworld with my style of graphics(horrible!!!!!) selling for $35 and selling over 1 million copies, it gives me hope.  Anyway, the goal of this prototyping is to create something similar to that and factorio but with a lot more craftable items.  So many items you won't be able to build them all on your world, you'll have to trade with others through a market that they set the prices.  Yes a stock market for goods!  It's a big undertaking, but once the basics are laid out, expanding with more recipes and items will be simple.

I never understood rimeorld.  So I feel that completely. It‚Äôs huge!! You got this bro! Get it done


[7/15/2022 6:05 AM] say_grr
The idea is start out like Rimworld where the Ai players are doing all the automation work for the factory until you expand to robotic automation and slowly have to decrease their work until they are no longer needed, but still need to be kept happy........  From capitalism to communism by force due to automation.  Pretty much our future!

Yeah it only counts actual matches (including pvt matches btw), but it doesn‚Äôt count freeplay, training packs, or workshop maps

One of the best pros in EU, Kash (who plays for Misfits :Misfits: ), only has 4k-5k hours officially. But, according to him/steam, he has an extra 1k-2k hours in freeplay alone


[7/15/2022 4:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
huh crazy


[7/15/2022 4:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i got to figure out how to incorporate the hundreds of bot mtches that ive been in.


[7/15/2022 4:29 PM] nebula1157
also KASH has been sign off and doesn't play for Misfits anymore.


[7/15/2022 4:30 PM] icybutmelting
I can see him joining Archie and Relatingwave to make an all England-nationality Endpoint :Endpoint: squad. Rumors have it that Metsanauris is gonna retire after Worlds


[7/15/2022 4:31 PM] icybutmelting
Archie is only on loan for Semper bc of no one being able to buy out his contract officially. He wants out completely and probably won‚Äôt be resigning with them.

[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ive only reached gc in rumblw which is supposedly a meme gamemode


[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
gc2 div 3 peak btw


[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] .codyyy
its not the gamemode itself, its just extra gamemodes are easier to get higher ransk then normal


[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
not rumble


[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] .codyyy
explain how you get gc2 in it


[7/15/2022 10:45 PM] .codyyy

[7/15/2022 10:46 PM] .codyyy
you accidentally proved my point lol


[7/15/2022 10:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i know its easier to get gc1 in hoops because of the low mmr difference


[7/15/2022 10:46 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
its like every win is a div up


[7/15/2022 10:46 PM] .codyyy
im so bad at hoops omg


[7/15/2022 10:46 PM] .codyyy
any extra gamemode honestly


[7/15/2022 10:47 PM] .codyyy
theyre all 2x+ lower then normal gamemodes


[7/15/2022 10:47 PM] .codyyy
like theyre dia or lower


[7/15/2022 10:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
all rumble is is 3v3 with power ups


[7/15/2022 10:47 PM] .codyyy

@Trev my favorite ark mod that doesnt work and hasnt been updated in ages.. Red did high damage plus some fire, brown had extra damage to structures and extra resource harvesting, white had massive speed buff and some ice damage, green was just pure topor for knocking out better dinos.

I know my drug of choice, but deciding which version I would like to hit on next is difficult.  There's so many options, but I narrowed it down to 3.  Factorio, Captains of Industry, and Dyson Sphere Program.  I was leaning towards Factorio cause it is has been around a long time with a lot of mods, but then they went ahead and did something stupid.  They raised their price 10X for any russians........  Do they really think the russian gamers are responsible for the war or even have a stake in it at all........  So that narrowed it a bit.  Probably going to go with Dyson Sphere Program.  It looks like it has a lot to offer with it's multiple world builds and the Dyson Sphere itself!  Has anyone tried it or even read this far, lol?

@CrazyWiz_26 ive used 3 separate gpus in it and i know each one works so im thinking its mother board, except i dont have the spare parts or money top get the parts to diagnose.
Let alone do i need a new PC so ill just buy a whole new system and try to salvage the data from the HDDs

@CrazyWiz_26


[7/25/2022 7:15 AM] say_grr
There's always a small possibility it could be the power supply as well.  But my guess would be the motherboard without doing any testing.  Parts of a power supply have been known to fail while outputs are still putting out enough to start the PC, but not be enough to actually run it.  It can cause blue screens while playing games or just not have enough power to run the GPU all together.

me and my family have this thing where everyday after waking up, we go outside and sit on the porch practice gratefulness. We would all close our eyes and thank God in our mind for all of the blessings we have, all the people in our lives, and anything else that we are personally grateful for.

[7/27/2022 3:38 PM] trevlovespizza
I picked it up back when it released. I still jump on it every month or so. Online is very solid, we‚Äôll absolutely play that. 

Remember Skate? 
They‚Äôre finally releasing Skate 4 soon. 
It‚Äôs going to be Free to play which is gonna be awesome


[7/27/2022 4:02 PM] icybutmelting
SKATE 4 FREE TO PLAY?!


[7/27/2022 4:02 PM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôm worried the ‚Äústory mode‚Äù will be nothing, but to be fair, exploring n stuff was way more fun than any of the missions


[7/27/2022 4:08 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah! FTP. I‚Äôm fucking pumped! 

Unfortunately, you‚Äôre right, I loved the Story mode of the first 3, but it‚Äôs supposed to be a huge open world game with just other people always around. So it definitely makes it interesting. As long as micro transactions are cosmetic only and not p2w lol


[7/27/2022 4:09 PM] .codyyy
if it‚Äôs p2w that‚Äôll be sad


[7/27/2022 4:09 PM] icybutmelting
I don‚Äôt even know how they‚Äôd implement a p2w system with mf skateboards


[7/27/2022 4:10 PM] icybutmelting
Paid Cosmetic content is for sure gonna be a thing. I wouldn‚Äôt be mad if they had paid dlc items either for customizing skateparks or something


[7/27/2022 4:10 PM] say_grr
That one's easy.  Boards with better air, grind control, etc.....

{Reactions}
üëÜ

[7/27/2022 4:10 PM] trevlovespizza
Because there‚Äôs attributes typically in those games. They could limit to to having to pay to use a special currency to upgrade your skater for more speed, higher ollies, better balance, etc.


[7/27/2022 4:11 PM] icybutmelting
Im sure the internet would protest if they allowed that to happen‚Ä¶ but then again, it‚Äôs EA‚Ä¶ iTs iN tHe GaMe


[7/27/2022 4:12 PM] trevlovespizza
100% I‚Äôm fine with cosmetics though. They have to make their money, that‚Äôs not a big deal. I doubt they‚Äôd change their system based on outrage if they do make it p2w. Go look at SW Battlefront lol


[7/27/2022 4:12 PM] say_grr
You can protest all you want.  If they just want the money from the transactions, and they don't think they can do it with just cosmetics, you might get just that


[7/27/2022 4:12 PM] icybutmelting
Yeah nvm I‚Äôm convinced that they‚Äôll let you pay money to make your character Nyjah Huston on launch lol


[7/27/2022 4:12 PM] icybutmelting
Meanwhile everyone else has to grind stats through whatever experience


[7/27/2022 4:13 PM] icybutmelting
Imagine you start the game and can‚Äôt even pop shuvit without leveling up or paying for levels


[7/27/2022 4:13 PM] say_grr
There's a lot of games where microtransactions just save time.......  Saving a hundred hour grind for a few bucks.....


[7/27/2022 4:13 PM] trevlovespizza
I‚Äôm 100% okay with them having you spend money to max your characters stats. That‚Äôs absolutely okay. 

As long as it‚Äôs not locked behind 100s of hours of grinding for it. Or specific things

i wonder what all the bot trigger words are


[7/29/2022 8:23 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Hi triggers it. Clip triggers it. But what else?


[7/29/2022 8:23 PM] ProBot ‚ú®#5803
Your clip is probably shit.


[7/29/2022 8:23 PM] nebula1157

[7/29/2022 8:23 PM] ProBot ‚ú®#5803
Oh hey, kid.


[7/29/2022 8:25 PM] say_grr
That's weird.  I thought it would be the last trigger word in the sentence.  Must be the last trigger word added to the list that is used first.


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think the different trigger words have different needs


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
before they actually do something


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like saying hi


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think it just has to be hi


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and as long as the sentence/paragraph has the word clip in it, then i think it wiill say what it does


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] ProBot ‚ú®#5803
Your clip is probably shit.


[7/29/2022 8:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[7/29/2022 8:27 PM] say_grr
I think Trev is the only one that knows all the trigger words.  And it looks like Hi is set up to only trigger if it's alone.


[7/29/2022 8:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[7/30/2022 4:33 PM] say_grr
I think it registers the first trigger added then exits the loop.  When it checks the message, it checks for the first trigger word, if it doesn't exist, it will do the same thing again for the second word.  If it does exist, it will respond and exit the loop of checks.

The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  This is what I love about casual.  In ranked, the SSL smurfs that tends to show up usually doesn't have their tag on their alts.......

[8/2/2022 6:06 AM] otassin
why your saying its an alt ?


[8/2/2022 6:06 AM] say_grr
This one isn't, but when they smurf in ranked, they use other accounts.


[8/2/2022 6:06 AM] .codyyy
true


[8/2/2022 6:07 AM] otassin
do you refere to him or other people ? If you refere to him how do you know ?


[8/2/2022 6:08 AM] say_grr
Not just him.  It's the fact that during casual you usually know what you're getting as they flash their tags.  In ranked, they hide what they are.


[8/2/2022 6:09 AM] say_grr
I also have the tracker network app set up.  I can usually tell by how many wins they have if they are an alt in ranked, but I can't tell what their main is.  In casual, they usually play on their main so I know what kind of player it really is.


[8/2/2022 6:11 AM] otassin
i guess you really know him


[8/2/2022 6:32 AM] say_grr
The only thing I know about him is he was wearing an SSL tag.  With that knowledge, what I normally don't have in ranked (Alts can be GC1 to SSL, a big difference), I focused on putting all the pressure on him whenever he got close to the ball.  This is why I like casual over ranked.


[8/2/2022 6:36 AM] otassin
well hes 1800 and your 1600, your on casual game together because hes in party with 1600mmr; in ranked you will not meet him, its littelary impossible to tell if he have an alt, if he doesnt show hes title in ranked etc..., its not because you meet him in a casual game that you certainly will in ranked game


[8/2/2022 6:39 AM] otassin
and maybe in ranked what you meet is like C3 GC1 GC2 who's are peaking or just having a bad day, a C3 whos playing the best as he can can beat GC1 or even GC2, GC2 whos in a bad day can be beat by a C3


[8/2/2022 6:40 AM] say_grr
What I'm saying is he would have to be on an alt to play ranked.  If I met him in ranked on an alt, I wouldn't know at all that he is an SSL.  I would not have put that much pressure on him and we probably would have lost if he had space to work with.


[8/2/2022 6:41 AM] say_grr
What I meet in ranked are people with less than 500 wins at High Champ.  Almost impossible for someone to get that good that fast.  They are alts and knowing their true rank is impossible

Nebs if u wanna be her rebound, try being more assertive than usual. Be like ‚Äúdamn girl ur hot af, lemme spoil u. You deserve better.‚Äù 60% of the time, it works every time!


[8/3/2022 2:12 PM] icybutmelting
Jokes aside, crushes are lowkey anxiety bait. It‚Äôs worth going all or nothing, because honestly, rejection is better than waiting in fear.

sometimes, it depends on the girl tho

‚ÄúGo for it‚Äù is the correct advice. If they broke up this week, give it some time bc kids are weird and a break up doesn‚Äôt mean much in high school, if I remember correctly

I‚Äôve been on EU servers for an hour and not one person has went right goes. I‚Äôve been bamboozled


[8/4/2022 9:10 AM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs like half-common for me when I play EU cas. NA players are def more adamant about ‚Äúleft goes‚Äù than other servers, I think

[8/4/2022 12:06 PM] .codyyy
o


[8/4/2022 12:07 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but im pretty sure that if Bravado doesnt change the way they are playing rn, they arent going to go very far


[8/4/2022 12:08 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or get aquainted with playing really high players at RLCS Lan


[8/4/2022 12:09 PM] icybutmelting
The b stream broke on twitch lmfao


[8/4/2022 12:09 PM] icybutmelting

[8/4/2022 12:12 PM] say_grr
CJCJ is just there for every pass off their wall


[8/4/2022 12:12 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
CJCJ so better


[8/4/2022 12:12 PM] icybutmelting
B stream broke on YouTube too lol


[8/4/2022 12:13 PM] icybutmelting
CJCJ just wants it so much more than everyone on the field. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs determined to break his worlds curse


[8/4/2022 12:14 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i feel like Bravado is gc3


[8/4/2022 12:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
they havent scored yet is my point


[8/4/2022 12:15 PM] icybutmelting
The defense and rotations of experienced teams just completely shit on the mechanical teams from SSA and APAC


[8/4/2022 12:15 PM] icybutmelting
2die4 and snowwy from SSA are top 100 SSL ranked grinders lol


[8/4/2022 12:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
SSA?


[8/4/2022 12:16 PM] icybutmelting
Sub Saharan Africa


[8/4/2022 12:17 PM] icybutmelting
Everyone is SSL, but it‚Äôs not even close. I think it‚Äôs mainly bc of rotational speed and reads on defense


[8/4/2022 12:17 PM] icybutmelting
2die4 looks like jstn on the ball, but he can‚Äôt get the ball and is swarmed immediately with no options


[8/4/2022 12:19 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Jstn? Good Jstn or nOt rEallY GooD Jstn?


[8/4/2022 12:20 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
nah i feel like 2die4 is the better player on their team but idk anything


[8/4/2022 12:23 PM] .codyyy
they just can‚Äôt get anything solid


[8/4/2022 12:24 PM] say_grr
b stream is still down on twitch


[8/4/2022 12:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i only watch the mainstream anyway


[8/4/2022 12:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or rizzos stream


[8/4/2022 12:24 PM] .codyyy
it died


[8/4/2022 12:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
B for Bravado and b stream both prolly dead


[8/4/2022 12:25 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs up on YouTube but still a bit laggy. It‚Äôs still repeating the ‚Äútalent prediction.‚Äù Optic are probably clapping tho


[8/4/2022 12:25 PM] .codyyy
everytime i checked yt it was down too


[8/4/2022 12:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
FINALLY


[8/4/2022 12:28 PM] say_grr
B stream is back up


[8/4/2022 12:29 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[8/4/2022 12:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
wonder how the the club will play


[8/4/2022 12:36 PM] icybutmelting
Senbei strikers (former Tokyo verdy) looks so much faster and more comfortable than bravado. They look like real pros


[8/4/2022 12:36 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
cant wait


[8/4/2022 12:36 PM] icybutmelting
I think Orlando Pirates and Bravado don‚Äôt win a game this LAN unless they play each other


[8/4/2022 12:37 PM] say_grr
You've got to stop doing that......


[8/4/2022 12:37 PM] say_grr
As soon as you complimented them, a complete whiffed goal save


[8/4/2022 12:38 PM] icybutmelting
Kv1 is arguably the best 1v1 player on the Western Hemisphere. Aztromik is a SAM mechanical veteran and legend. Lostt is their best player and arguably the best player in SAM not on Furia


[8/4/2022 12:38 PM] icybutmelting
The icy curse is real lmao

Dignitas dumpin trash all over Gladiators


[8/4/2022 1:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
7-0 game 3 and apparently the Gladiators only scored twice in all the games


[8/4/2022 1:59 PM] say_grr
Watching the webcams, it looks like gladiators are winning.


[8/4/2022 2:00 PM] say_grr
Gladiators are all laughing and smiling while dignitas looks al serious


[8/4/2022 2:01 PM] icybutmelting
According to Lawler, there‚Äôs a lot of stuff going on in the background with Dig :Dignitas: that‚Äôs gonna mess with their chemistry and mentality

[8/4/2022 2:15 PM] blissfury
Probably a bit late though


[8/4/2022 2:17 PM] icybutmelting
It would be fun to try just because! I feel like bubble CA pros like Jordan, Sosa, Blaze., Freshness, Radoko, etc. would farm other competition tho


[8/4/2022 2:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i can only enter 1v1 money tournaments since i hv no team


[8/4/2022 2:18 PM] blissfury
Would be great to get slapped around


[8/4/2022 2:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but that kinda helps with my 1v1s


[8/4/2022 2:19 PM] blissfury
I mean I could get immortal if he was available


[8/4/2022 2:19 PM] blissfury
Maybe I can meet a pro though


[8/4/2022 2:22 PM] blissfury
Probably a low chance one of the big dogs to be here like Squishy, Lethamyr, Jknaps, or corruptG


[8/4/2022 2:23 PM] icybutmelting
Leth is hella busy, and I think squishy and jknaps would think the prize pool is too low lol


[8/4/2022 2:23 PM] icybutmelting
Birch, bliss, and typical Canadian next pro team?


[8/4/2022 2:24 PM] blissfury

[8/4/2022 2:24 PM] icybutmelting
Side note regarding the RLCS‚Ä¶ honestly it‚Äôs kinda boring if there are no upsets for the first day of worlds lol


[8/4/2022 2:24 PM] blissfury
Would need minimum 5k hours in Rocket


[8/4/2022 2:24 PM] blissfury
Would still probably be like GC 1

[8/5/2022 12:14 PM] lt_milkshake
No


[8/5/2022 12:14 PM] lt_milkshake
It can CAUSE cancer if enough is inhaled

[8/5/2022 3:53 PM] icybutmelting
Yeah the scheduling especially is hard to grasp. Long story short, if a team gets to 3 match wins, they‚Äôre through, and if a team gets to 3 match losses, they‚Äôre out


[8/5/2022 3:53 PM] .codyyy
but on a serious note


[8/5/2022 3:53 PM] .codyyy

Full agree on COVID being to blame for social disintegration. Multiple studies have basically confirmed the trend


[8/5/2022 4:08 PM] .codyyy
honestly it was the opposite for me


[8/5/2022 4:08 PM] .codyyy
but only cuz of my ex

Honestly though if you don‚Äôt touch other ppl, you won‚Äôt get monkey pox. It‚Äôs a lot harder to transmit than COVID. Just wash your hands relatively often and you‚Äôll be fine


[8/5/2022 4:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thats what they all say


[8/5/2022 4:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
So many people around here acting like Covid dont exist and they suffer the concequences of it


[8/5/2022 4:13 PM] icybutmelting
I literally work in biochemistry lol you can #trustmebro


[8/5/2022 4:14 PM] icybutmelting
The recent omicron variants of COVID are extremely weak (about 10-30x less deadly than previous variants). They‚Äôre transmissible af, sure, but even 80 year olds are shrugging it off these days


[8/5/2022 4:14 PM] icybutmelting
If you‚Äôre vaccinated, chances are, you‚Äôll barely feel sick


[8/5/2022 4:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
same thing gonna happen with this next stuff and whatever else THEY are gonna throw at us people. Theres going to be a panic and then after a while they'll go back to normal like nothing happened


[8/5/2022 4:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
U have proof of this fact?


[8/5/2022 4:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
U hv proof, ill believe, but Covid is such a controversial topic


[8/5/2022 4:18 PM] say_grr
The proof is in the number of hospitalizations of vaccinated vs non-vaccinated now that a bunch of people are vaccinated.


[8/5/2022 4:19 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
I only know what ive seen and heard from friends and family, and it affects all people differently. My uncle got covid and was Vac'd and he still had boughts of throwing up and headhurtis. Same with his son. They are doing better now but they way covid works, theres definitely some leftover damage


[8/5/2022 4:20 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i Just hate disease, covid being the 1st ive ever lived through. CRAZY!


[8/5/2022 4:22 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i wonder if them people in the past felt the same way or even worse as me during the black death, the spanish flu, and others


[8/5/2022 4:27 PM] say_grr
Was that from this strain that is currently being transmitted, or one of the earlier ones.


[8/5/2022 4:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
not this one but the last one i think

The only other player to do that for the past couple years in RL is his tm8, oKhaliD

He's currently still #1 in 1s and 2s, but has dropped ~25 mmr away from #1 in 3s

[8/8/2022 1:33 PM] hoglishva
Japanese style forum that is the litteral shithole of the internet


[8/8/2022 2:29 PM] icybutmelting
Yes, it‚Äôs from the 2014 World Cup, where home team (and favorites) Brazil got absolutely demolished by Germany (who went on to win the whole tournament). In top-level soccer, losing 3-0 is considered a complete stomping, so 7-1 was straight up a tragedy. Brazilians were crying in the stands and there were fans that even committed suicide over this result.


[8/8/2022 2:30 PM] icybutmelting
Brazil were missing their star players, Neymar (an attacker) and Thiago Silva (a Defender), but still, this result was not expected


[8/8/2022 2:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so brazil got Germany'd


[8/8/2022 2:30 PM] hoglishva
god damn football hits different, so much more passion from the fans.

NRG ofc has a lot of fans, so ofc they‚Äôre gonna want them to do better and win, as do i. but they haven‚Äôt been performing so i don‚Äôt see it happening unless they straighten up next weekend.

In terms of skill and consistency for NA, no one even comes close to the big 3 of Atomic, Firstkiller, and Beastmode.

Imo this is SSG‚Äôs best chance to beat Moist. Moist start slow and tend to go lower bracket a lot


[8/9/2022 3:18 PM] icybutmelting
Plus SSG are hot off of wildcard

I don't think you can change simple poll responses.  the only options are thumbs up or thumbs down.  Next time word the question to be something like "Will G2 beat Optic?"

Then again, there is no real results for this poll, just what we see so we can actually just use the icons for them if Trev added them.

Recently i receive a warning for a playlist "watch later" that apparently "was a violation of the community guidelines for child safety" 
I try to look further there was nothing so i made a appeal about it and it was rejected and didn't send a reason.
So i contact YouTube on Twitter to know the reason, they look further about it and also didn't find a reason so now i don't have a warning anymore and everything's fine, lets goo üòÑ

[8/11/2022 11:50 AM] otassin
you can see that i got the warning in 2020 but  didn't pay attention, from my 1st tweet to youtube it was remove in 3 days


[8/11/2022 11:51 AM] otassin
i was an error i have litelary 0 video where i put safe for kids, it was on a playlist premade by YouTube


[8/11/2022 11:53 AM] say_grr
That's crazy.  Nothing is 100% perfect when it comes to trying to prevent "evil" from penetrating their system.  glad they are actually doing something to fix the errors, even if it looks like it takes forever.  They do have a lot of "customers"


[8/11/2022 11:55 AM] otassin
the warning didn't do anything to me so i was chilling to be honest even if they didn't remove it just wanted to know what that was, but the thing that surprise me was the appeal rejected x)


[8/11/2022 11:56 AM] say_grr
That was weird.  Like they didn't even look at it, but trusted the algorithms results.


[8/11/2022 11:57 AM] say_grr
Plus, they prioritize videos with more views or people with a lot of followers.  They don't want to look bad and more customers see those videos so......  They just have to take care of them first.


[8/11/2022 11:57 AM] otassin
yea, when you appeal i expect it to be look up but visibly they made 2 times the same mistakes


[8/11/2022 11:58 AM] otassin
for me it's normal, i don't made money for them ad even if they don't remove anything i will not made a big drama on them


[8/11/2022 11:59 AM] say_grr
I would bet they have a system where they check the views of the video and decide whether it's worth their time to do manual labor, (man hours) to look it up.  Probably a problem for anyone that isn't making money off youtube


[8/11/2022 12:01 PM] otassin
i don't know about that but if they did that like i said i will not really be surprised because i don't made money for them, that it take time or not as long as they actually look i don't really care if they like me or not XD


[8/11/2022 12:34 PM] say_grr

are s5 ssl tournament winners actually in c3?

or was the guy in my c3 3s match just carried


[8/13/2022 2:56 AM] say_grr
Tournaments are a different beast.  A GC2 can get an SSL tournament title with the right teammates, not getting carried, but playing well.  A lot of times GC's get thrown into SSL tournaments if there isn't enough to fill it up(GC3).


[8/13/2022 2:56 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
huh


[8/13/2022 2:56 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thats messed up


[8/13/2022 2:58 AM] say_grr
It's because of the lack of tournament participation.  It's like waiting a long time for que and ending up with a rank above or below where you're at.

[8/14/2022 1:01 PM] lt_milkshake
The crowd didn‚Äôt want Faze to win


[8/14/2022 1:01 PM] .codyyy

[8/14/2022 1:02 PM] say_grr
I thought the crowd wanted NRG to win, and Version 1 stomped NRG in the first round!  This gives them a chance


[8/14/2022 1:02 PM] lt_milkshake
Ppl wanted SSG to win


[8/14/2022 1:03 PM] lt_milkshake
So now it‚Äôs moist ppl want

[8/14/2022 3:01 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
seikoo insane


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] jdawg68
ok but in my opinion noone looks more dangerous than G2


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] .codyyy
eh it‚Äôs hard to say tho, nrg got smothered hard, they weren‚Äôt doing anything insane against them either


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] jdawg68
by far in my opinion most explosive team w most scoring potential


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] .codyyy
because of chicago ü§£


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] jdawg68
nrg played well


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] .codyyy
not really tbh


[8/14/2022 3:02 PM] .codyyy
they played that one good game


[8/14/2022 3:03 PM] .codyyy
they had good d tho


[8/14/2022 3:03 PM] jdawg68
i mean thats just what g2 does, yea they did have good d cuz thats all they were allowed to do lol


[8/14/2022 3:03 PM] .codyyy
i meant nrg


[8/14/2022 3:03 PM] jdawg68
its not like that was their game plan, g2 just stopped all their ambitions


[8/14/2022 3:03 PM] .codyyy
nrg, we all know is so much better then that but they haven‚Äôt shown it


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] jdawg68
yea nrg did have good d


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] .codyyy
don‚Äôt get me wrong, g2 did amazing towards them


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
nrg vs g2 was a let down


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] jdawg68
i mean, like i said they did good in my opinion, g2 is just better


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] .codyyy
but i still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough against moist


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] .codyyy
i want g2 to win


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] .codyyy
but i don‚Äôt see it happening


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it might


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] .codyyy
i don‚Äôt my hopes up high and get let down


[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
u never know

[8/14/2022 3:04 PM] jdawg68
i loved that series, watching a team pop off like that is fun to watch


[8/14/2022 3:05 PM] .codyyy
g2 v nrg was boring imo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[8/14/2022 3:05 PM] jdawg68
i enjoyed it


[8/14/2022 3:05 PM] jdawg68
much more entertaining than bds vs kcorp


[8/14/2022 3:06 PM] jdawg68
to me


[8/14/2022 3:08 PM] jdawg68
idk if g2 will keep that performance tho, they were peaking, its hard to play at that level for a prolonged time but if they play at that level for the remainder they are winning it all


[8/14/2022 3:35 PM] icybutmelting
Idk what kinda rocket league you watching lmao


[8/14/2022 3:35 PM] .codyyy
üíÄ what he said


[8/14/2022 3:35 PM] icybutmelting
G2 look insane don‚Äôt get me wrong, but BDS vs KCorp had both teams going insane


[8/14/2022 3:36 PM] .codyyy
g2 never performs when it counts the most


[8/14/2022 3:36 PM] lt_milkshake
HUH, you liked g2 v NRG kore than kcorp v bds


[8/14/2022 3:36 PM] .codyyy
why do you think they haven‚Äôt won a worlds :/


[8/14/2022 3:41 PM] jdawg68
lol, i mean ig i just have differing opinions about it, i do agree i dont think g2 can maintain that level tho


[8/14/2022 3:43 PM] jdawg68
and wiz yes i did, it was just better RL in my opinion


[8/14/2022 3:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what withthe fortnite ad


[8/14/2022 3:48 PM] jdawg68
now maybe after this moist series my stance may change but peak bds vs peak g2 is a no brainer (g2)


[8/14/2022 3:48 PM] jdawg68
smf j ifk but the music on the ad lowkey goes hard


[8/14/2022 3:49 PM] jdawg68
idk*


[8/14/2022 3:49 PM] icybutmelting
BDS didn‚Äôt peak either, but right now, G2 does look better imo


[8/14/2022 3:49 PM] icybutmelting
Moist still are #1 until proven otherwise


[8/14/2022 3:49 PM] jdawg68
thats y i say ill have to see this series then i may change my mind about g2 taking it


[8/14/2022 3:49 PM] jdawg68
(given they play at the same level)


[8/14/2022 3:50 PM] jdawg68
and what is imo?


[8/14/2022 3:50 PM] jdawg68
ive seen it alot


[8/14/2022 3:50 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
in my opinion


[8/14/2022 3:50 PM] jdawg68
ohh okay yea ill strart using that


[8/14/2022 3:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[8/14/2022 5:14 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and everyone forgot about the fane clash im sure


[8/14/2022 5:15 PM] say_grr
That RL "Commercial"/ short just shows how rocket League makes you toxic!


[8/14/2022 5:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Moist is 3rd and nrg is 1st, and Falcons are 2nd


[8/14/2022 5:15 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
in fan clash btw


[8/14/2022 5:25 PM] say_grr
Anyone of these 4 teams can take this in the Finals..........

Gonna be interesting


[8/14/2022 6:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
G2 for the win


[8/14/2022 6:16 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
g2 vs furia


[8/14/2022 6:16 PM] lt_milkshake
Furia still has to play bds


[8/14/2022 6:17 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
true but Furia vs G2


[8/14/2022 6:17 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
will be amazing im sure


[8/14/2022 6:18 PM] lt_milkshake
Hopefully, cuz that series was so bored I genuinely want to go home rn


[8/14/2022 6:41 PM] jdawg68
g2 beat faze?


[8/14/2022 6:41 PM] .codyyy
yeah


[8/14/2022 6:41 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah


[8/14/2022 6:41 PM] jdawg68
theyre playing the winner of this series?


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] .codyyy
yessir


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] icybutmelting
Winner of this series claps G2 prob


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] .codyyy
i can‚Äôt wait to find out how it goes tho


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] lt_milkshake
Big facts


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] .codyyy
idk if furia can do what they did against moist again


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] .codyyy
that had to drain them


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] bwhitbucky
Furia is my vote


[8/14/2022 6:42 PM] jdawg68
i still stick to my statement that if they play the way they did against nrg they are winning


[8/14/2022 6:43 PM] .codyyy
i dunno


[8/14/2022 6:43 PM] .codyyy
i personally don‚Äôt think so


[8/14/2022 6:43 PM] .codyyy
furia or bds can over power even g2


[8/14/2022 6:44 PM] jdawg68
fair enough


[8/14/2022 6:44 PM] .codyyy
g2 went up against an okay NRG, if NRG was at their peak again, g2, imo would lose


[8/14/2022 6:44 PM] jdawg68
i personally just dont think any otther team reads the game and reacts as fast as g2


[8/14/2022 6:45 PM] .codyyy
to be found out


[8/14/2022 6:45 PM] .codyyy
all there is to it


[8/14/2022 6:45 PM] jdawg68
u guys keep saying it was nrg's game to lose, that they played bad


[8/14/2022 6:45 PM] jdawg68
like no that was the result of perfect Rl from g2


[8/14/2022 6:46 PM] jdawg68
they made no mistakes, actually, and i havent seen that level from any other team, but like i said that level of play isnt sustainable so if they dont bring it they may very well lose i agree


[8/14/2022 7:03 PM] icybutmelting
No NRG was trash


[8/14/2022 7:03 PM] icybutmelting
NRG wasn‚Äôt good enough to force mistakes


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] jdawg68
well if theres a team thatll give g2 a run for it, itll be furia


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] jdawg68
at their current form


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] trevlovespizza
Duh Furia is the best team every season


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] .codyyy
if furia keeps playing like this, g2 will lose


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] .codyyy
no doubt


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] jdawg68
not if g2 plays the way they did against nrg


[8/14/2022 7:04 PM] lt_milkshake
They usually avg 6th place tho


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] icybutmelting
NRG would have lost to every other team


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] trevlovespizza
G2 is trash


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] say_grr
NRG couldn't get the ball out of there QUARTER of the field for the longest time


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] icybutmelting
They played SEMPER with 2 COVID players


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] .codyyy
exactly


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] trevlovespizza
Because they want the other teams to have a chance to make it fair obvi


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] say_grr
Not even half


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] jdawg68
yea and among every other series that series was the most dominant


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] icybutmelting
Yes, G2 are a top team in the world, no doubt


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] jdawg68
eevery other team may have beaten them but g2 completely crushed them


[8/14/2022 7:05 PM] trevlovespizza
Top 40 at least


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] jdawg68
def trev


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] icybutmelting
I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôd get swept or even perfect swept vs another team


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] lt_milkshake
You are the most band wagon person I‚Äôve ever seen


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] jdawg68
thats a complete hypothetical lol


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] .codyyy
sometimes g2 couldn‚Äôt score


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] trevlovespizza
No


[8/14/2022 7:06 PM] jdawg68
theres not relly an argument for that


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] .codyyy
you forget trev messes around all the time


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] icybutmelting
Trev supported Furia from day 1 of worlds tho


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] trevlovespizza
I always tell everyone Furia is my favorite team


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] icybutmelting
:Furia: :Furia: :Furia:


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs the point, I know he‚Äôs kidding


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] .codyyy
i didn‚Äôt know that^


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] jdawg68
but they had 10000% control of the game at all times


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] icybutmelting
AGAINST NRG


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] trevlovespizza
Theyre the first rlcs team I ever watched so I kind of have an attachment to them now lol


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] jdawg68
yes


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] icybutmelting
G2 got clapped by Karmine Corp


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] jdawg68
however, if g2 continues at that form they beat any other team


[8/14/2022 7:07 PM] jdawg68
in 7


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] trevlovespizza
Even if I won‚Äôt win that fan clash event because not enough Furia fans ü•≤


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] jdawg68
nrg isnt a bunch of bots


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] .codyyy
nrg barely won against a team of covid. lmfao


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] .codyyy
and they got a game on g2


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] icybutmelting
They were not top 10 this tournament


[8/14/2022 7:08 PM] icybutmelting
That simple


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] icybutmelting
Both Falcons and SSG had much better tournaments


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] .codyyy
nrg shouldn‚Äôt have made it so far whatsoever lol


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] .codyyy
not with their performance


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] icybutmelting
They had a Mickey bracket


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] icybutmelting
They got to play Semper-19


[8/14/2022 7:09 PM] .codyyy
they had the easiest bracket no cap


[8/14/2022 7:10 PM] jdawg68
we can keep goin at this u can bring ur stats and what not but SUBJECTIVELY (in my opinion, prespective, perception, etc) i think if g2 plays at that same level they beat anyone else too


[8/14/2022 7:10 PM] jdawg68
and yes if they do not perform at that level theres a good chance they lose lol


[8/14/2022 7:10 PM] .codyyy
proven with the past, g2 can never step up when it comes to worlds


[8/14/2022 7:10 PM] jdawg68
yes it was nrg, not the best team, but they still played perfectly


[8/14/2022 7:11 PM] jdawg68
plain and simple, perfect rl beats amazing rl any day


[8/14/2022 7:11 PM] icybutmelting
John I agree with everything you said, I just want to reiterate that NRG are not good anymore


[8/14/2022 7:11 PM] .codyyy
you say it‚Äôs perfect

[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] jdawg68
more perfect than any other team ive seen play in this tourney


[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] icybutmelting
They haven‚Äôt played a top 5 team yet


[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] icybutmelting
So they look great against teams they‚Äôre better than


[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] icybutmelting
They WILL make mistakes vs teams that challenge them


[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] jdawg68
then they may get crushed, im not counting it out as a possibility


[8/14/2022 7:12 PM] icybutmelting
They will not be perfect


[8/14/2022 7:13 PM] icybutmelting
G2 win the finals imo


[8/14/2022 7:13 PM] jdawg68

No if they played the way they played against NRG, they get swept


[8/14/2022 7:13 PM] .codyyy
i want g2 to win regardless, you‚Äôre just heavily overestimating their abilities based on who‚Äôve they have played against


[8/14/2022 7:13 PM] trevlovespizza
NRG didn‚Äôt do anything though


[8/14/2022 7:14 PM] icybutmelting
G2 played slow and pretty careless against NRG


[8/14/2022 7:14 PM] .codyyy
g2 should have scored way more against nrg


[8/14/2022 7:14 PM] jdawg68
lol trev

Seikoo is good, but without the disruption of Marc by 8, I'm not putting my faith in BDS

Jdawg I hope you rewatch the VOD to see the brilliance that was the last two games of Moist vs. Furia


[8/14/2022 7:16 PM] say_grr
They're good, but the way they are playing right now, slow and steady, isn't working when the pressure keeps them from crossing midfield


[8/14/2022 7:16 PM] trevlovespizza
They‚Äôve looked that way for months


[8/14/2022 7:16 PM] jdawg68
so yes they made a rlcs team look like gcs lol

Yeah because of the points balance so it screwed them over. Sucks, for sure. But people are demanding devs answer their cries, or saying top 2 deserve it. It‚Äôs a cool explosion but I mean come on, it‚Äôs not that cool

Apparently it ended and said Moist won, but then a bit later it changed and said NRG won and it gave them the 1st place rewards and everyone else the rest of it. THEN this morning it said Moist won again. But also some people sent screenshots where it said Endpoint won. So obviously little gamers are pissed and demanding what they ‚Äúrightfully‚Äù won in a free event that doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. It‚Äôs hilarious honestly.

Translation: he used to play club football with a team (as a goalkeeper, I believe), but because of injury (and maybe other stuff), he is no longer allowed to follow his dream of playing with the club. Now he is watching his replacement play instead, who is less talented than Hamza himself

Chances are you weren‚Äôt the next Manuel Neuer. Injuries happen. Pick back up and continue following other goals. Also, if you still want to dedicate yourself to football, don‚Äôt give up and continue training with rehab. Chances are, you could excel with future tryouts

When :Furia: beat Moist. 

They definitely quiet the crowd during the stream.

Spacestation Gaming are expected to kick Retals before the #RLCS 2022-23 season.

The organization will be targeting Oxygen Esports' Lj as his replacement.

[8/15/2022 3:15 PM] lt_milkshake
WHY


[8/15/2022 3:16 PM] trevlovespizza
Isn‚Äôt Retals good??


[8/15/2022 3:16 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs my point


[8/15/2022 3:16 PM] icybutmelting
Also, all of Semper  are free agents, with ExotiiK being highly sought after by Vitality :Vitality: to replace Kaydop and entice Alpha54 to stay


[8/15/2022 3:17 PM] icybutmelting
Short answer, yes, but Lj is better. Lj is Oxygen‚Äôs hard carry, and along with Zineel, Daniel, and Aqua, he‚Äôs one of NA‚Äôs few young talents


[8/15/2022 3:19 PM] icybutmelting
RW9 (pronounced Ruh-wass) and Nwpo (pronounced New-poh) are also free agents, and both are targeted to replace oKhaliD on Falcons. If not, RW9, Nwpo, and Killeerz (RW9‚Äôs twin brother) may also form a team, as they have done so in the past.


[8/15/2022 3:20 PM] lt_milkshake
Why would okhalid get replaced?


[8/15/2022 3:21 PM] icybutmelting
Same reason Retals :SSG: might get replaced. The meta is shifting and they‚Äôre not consistently mechanical enough, it seems.


[8/15/2022 3:21 PM] icybutmelting
There are even talks of Extra being replaced on BDS :BDS: , so who knows what‚Äôs up


[8/15/2022 3:22 PM] lt_milkshake
If that‚Äôs the case, then all of V1 except BEASTMODE should be replaced


[8/15/2022 3:23 PM] icybutmelting
There‚Äôs talks of Torment being replaced by Retals or Mist, actually


[8/15/2022 3:23 PM] icybutmelting
Also, NA is severely weak with talent. There‚Äôs only 8 or so S tier players in the whole region


[8/15/2022 3:24 PM] icybutmelting
NA orgs are looking to offer EU talent contracts and Visas as well (Rezears and Gomb are rumored to possibly come to NA)


[8/15/2022 3:39 PM] icybutmelting
There‚Äôs even talks of Furia replacing CaioTG1 with Lostt from Club

This kinda why i dont like the behind the scenes. In a way they are putting Friends against each other, if they regard each other as that anyway. Theres not really friends in the business place.


[8/15/2022 4:03 PM] icybutmelting
Renegades are targeting Amphis from PWR as well as Hawk from Dire Wolves

OMFG!!!!!!!  I was going through replays making clips using OBS to do it.  Done this a hundred times so no big deal unless you're a dumbass and still have the screen set for Dyson Spere Program(last stream).  over 2 hours of going through every replay(over 100) and recording the highlights if there were any.  Now I got me a lot of black screen videos!

and it'll send u the link to ur discord if u link it or the gif your game app.


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] jdawg68
and ohhh okay so when i hit a clip, just f8 then it uploads to the app?


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] .codyyy
ye


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] icybutmelting
Once gifyourgame is up and running, check the app and see what your ‚Äúzero impact clipping‚Äù keybind is (it‚Äôs usually F8). Once you do, have it running in the background while using rocket league and press F8 either mid-game after something happens you want clipped, OR, while watching a replay file


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] jdawg68
ohh bet


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] .codyyy
make sure u do it right after u score like a few secs


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] .codyyy
easiest way


[8/17/2022 3:10 PM] .codyyy
unless u go back to the replay


[8/17/2022 3:11 PM] jdawg68
thanks guys


[8/17/2022 3:11 PM] icybutmelting
And once you have the clip in gifyourgame, you can copy a link to post it here (it will auto-make the vid on discord with just the link). To download the video to make a compilation vid and more, copy/paste the link into a browser and download the video that way


[8/17/2022 3:12 PM] say_grr
It records everything, then when you press F8, it will convert the last (?) seconds of gameplay.  I don't know the exact length and whether you can change it or not


[8/17/2022 3:12 PM] icybutmelting
It used to be 15, but they made that behind a paywall now. It only clips what it believes the last goal/assist/save was


[8/17/2022 3:12 PM] odan9772
if ur like me and have an elite controller with a paddle that isnt bound, i just change it to f8 and can hit it super quick and easy, catches saves, demos, bumps all the fun stuff.

[8/18/2022 10:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i was just saying hey i saw ur post


[8/18/2022 11:00 PM] jdawg68
ill 1v1 you J


[8/18/2022 11:01 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ok


[8/18/2022 11:14 PM] nebula1157
You can‚Äôt find a number before 1,000 that has the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù in it.


[8/18/2022 11:17 PM] lt_milkshake
One hundred and one^


[8/18/2022 11:17 PM] nebula1157
That‚Äôs incorrect grammar


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] nebula1157
Lmao


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] lt_milkshake
No it‚Äôs now


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] lt_milkshake
Not


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] itsjustmejess
?


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs how you spell out 101


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] nebula1157
You say and in reference to money or time


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or one o one


[8/18/2022 11:18 PM] nebula1157
Or One hundred one


[8/18/2022 11:19 PM] nebula1157
Also is and a number?


[8/18/2022 11:19 PM] lt_milkshake
How do you pronounce 101 when saying it then?


[8/18/2022 11:19 PM] lt_milkshake
It‚Äôs ‚Äú100 and 1‚Äù


[8/18/2022 11:19 PM] lt_milkshake
Therefore to spell it out using letters is one hundred and one


[8/18/2022 11:19 PM] nebula1157
It‚Äôs incorrect grammar, I also say it like that, but I‚Äôm wrong


[8/18/2022 11:20 PM] lt_milkshake
That is how 99.9999% of the world pronounces 101


[8/18/2022 11:20 PM] nebula1157
And 99.9999% of the world is wrong lmao


[8/18/2022 11:23 PM] lt_milkshake

[8/18/2022 11:23 PM] lt_milkshake
BOTH ARE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT


[8/18/2022 11:23 PM] nebula1157
Again is ‚Äúand‚Äù a number


[8/18/2022 11:23 PM] nebula1157
I don‚Äôt remember AND being a number


[8/18/2022 11:23 PM] lt_milkshake
it‚Äôs part of the number when you spell it out


[8/18/2022 11:24 PM] nebula1157
Wrong


[8/18/2022 11:24 PM] nebula1157
Part then,


[8/18/2022 11:24 PM] nebula1157
And is part of a number and not a full number. Therefore my statement still stands


[8/18/2022 11:25 PM] jdawg68
in one hundred one


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] jdawg68
only say and when theres a decimal point


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] jdawg68
so 101.1 is one hundred one and one tenth


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what he said


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] lt_milkshake
News Flash: I‚Äôve known this stupid fucking question for years and I know that there‚Äôs no obvious answer


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] lt_milkshake
When you write it on a check what is it?


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] lt_milkshake
‚ÄúOne hundred and one‚Äù


[8/18/2022 11:26 PM] jdawg68
no, the and is only there for hundrenths


[8/18/2022 11:27 PM] jdawg68
anything after the decimal


[8/18/2022 11:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
100.1001


[8/18/2022 11:27 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
theres it is


[8/18/2022 11:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
one hundred point one thous**a**nd one


[8/18/2022 11:28 PM] jdawg68
not quite lol


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ik im saying it wrong


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but its still a thousandth


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] lt_milkshake
If it‚Äôs after a decimal it‚Äôs xxx ‚Äúpoint‚Äù yyy


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] jdawg68
or and


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] blissfury
0 = 1?


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] jdawg68
im just saying its the only acceptable time to say and in a number


[8/18/2022 11:29 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what about -1


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] jdawg68
same concept applies


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] jdawg68
just say negative


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] blissfury
. 99 = 1


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] jdawg68
prior


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] jdawg68
no


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
neg**a**tive one


[8/18/2022 11:30 PM] jdawg68
.99 = 1- .01


[8/18/2022 11:31 PM] jdawg68
i mean u can just round it up tho and noone would know lol


[8/18/2022 11:31 PM] blissfury
No jdawg .99 = 1


[8/18/2022 11:31 PM] jdawg68
so sure


[8/18/2022 11:31 PM] jdawg68
only whole numbers in this bih lol


[8/18/2022 11:31 PM] blissfury
I can prove it mathematically


[8/18/2022 11:32 PM] jdawg68
i mean if were rounding then yea u can say .99=1


[8/18/2022 11:32 PM] jdawg68
i wouldnt scrutinize u lol


[8/18/2022 11:33 PM] blissfury
I‚Äôm not rounding


[8/18/2022 11:33 PM] jdawg68
.99 isnt even 1 when ur buying something, bastards charge ya 1.06 smh


[8/18/2022 11:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
tax smh


[8/18/2022 11:34 PM] jdawg68

ggs night


[8/19/2022 5:02 AM] icybutmelting
Lmfao y'all some mf lawyers in here (myself included). I'm on Neb's side for the letter number argument:


[8/19/2022 5:02 AM] icybutmelting
"Letters A, B and C do not appear anywhere in the spellings from 1 to 999, while letter A comes for the first time in 1000 (thousand). Letters B and C do not appear anywhere in the spellings from 1 to 999,999,999, while letter B comes for the first time in 1,000,000,000 (billion)."


[8/19/2022 5:02 AM] icybutmelting
But also who tf cares


[8/19/2022 5:04 AM] icybutmelting
Also, Bliss's mention of 0.99 equaling 1 is almost correct... the theory that 0.9... (read aloud as "zero point 9 repeating") equals 1 is widely accepted. A simple proof of that is that a number between 0.9... and 1 does not exist, therefore, they equal each other


[8/19/2022 5:05 AM] icybutmelting
0.9... is also the formal notation for three thirds (3/3)


[8/19/2022 5:09 AM] icybutmelting
There's a lot of really cool math theorems that I got to learn while picking up my mathematics minor... from simpler ones (0! = 1, or read as "zero factorial equals one") to complicated ones, like some infinities are more infinite than others (countable infinity vs. incountable infinity), and the Ramanujan summation (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + ‚àû = -1/12, or the sum of all positive integers = approximately -0.08333)


[8/19/2022 5:10 AM] icybutmelting
The sum of all positive integers being -1/12 blew my mind when I first learned about it, but it's widely accepted and one of the bases for advanced physics


[8/19/2022 5:10 AM] icybutmelting
Thank u for coming to my TED talk lmfao good morning to ppl reading this

Y‚Äôall, do NOT ever get Wendy‚Äôs French toast sticks. They‚Äôre genuinely the absolute WORST fast food item I‚Äôve ever tried in my life and I‚Äôm not exaggerating

The Most Disappointing Fast Food Breakfast Item Yet
Wendy's has recently released their new Homestyle French Toast Sticks! Described as offering a "perfect balance of a soft, custardy interior and crisp, golden-brown crust with notes of vanilla" this item sounds promising! Sadly in reality, it was a total disappointment.

I‚Äôve had Wendy‚Äôs breakfast before and it‚Äôs normally pretty good! It‚Äôs crazy that the sticks are awful. Maybe they‚Äôll get enough bad reviews and do something to make a fix with them

Rogue set to move forward without Taroco heading into #RLCS 2022-23.

- Taroco didn't re-sign with Rogue.
- Chronic is the favorite to complete the roster as of this moment.

and we get scored on or i have to rush to get back


[8/23/2022 4:01 PM] icybutmelting
Honestly literally just shadow and dont attack at all until diamond. It's just open net simulator whenever a mistake happens lol


[8/23/2022 4:02 PM] icybutmelting
Smurfs don't end even till GC2. Smurfs tend to overcommitt though so it can still be winnable. @Grr8-_-Ness actually is a smurf-killer with his playstyle lol


[8/23/2022 4:04 PM] icybutmelting
It's honestly why I use such a 1s heavy playstyle when I solo q. I know if my tm8 won't do anything productive, I'll just score everything by myself when I get the chance


[8/23/2022 4:04 PM] icybutmelting
But also, I play passive af until the gameplay makes me choose otherwise


[8/23/2022 4:05 PM] icybutmelting
At the same time, I think that playstyle hinders our team's gameplay when my tm8 is actually good. I tend to play too passive in 2s


[8/23/2022 4:12 PM] .codyyy
i just tried to play normally with rotating and such and they would go for stupid shit/miss and we would be screwed


[8/23/2022 4:22 PM] otassin
if you play with randoms you can't really help the only thing that you should do is adapt yourself to them hes play style, 
if he ballchase focus on defending, pass more etc... sadly if he don't consider yourself as a teamate be very aware of him like an enemy


[8/23/2022 4:28 PM] icybutmelting
Honestly I spend more time focusing on my tm8s movement than my opponents when solo q‚Äôing lol


[8/23/2022 4:30 PM] otassin
personally i don't really know on what i'm focusing the more, they're a lot of things to think about XD


[8/23/2022 4:34 PM] say_grr
Chase ball, everything else on the field is an obstacle, LMAO


[8/23/2022 4:39 PM] say_grr
But seriously, the better they are, the less space you should give them on defense.  For Offense, I spend the first minute of gameplay watching my teammates.  If they can keep the ball on the other end of the field, I'll play 3rd and sit midfield.  If they keep turning after one hit, I start chasing and try my best to keep the ball on their end of the field.


[8/23/2022 4:40 PM] say_grr
I don't play 2's solo que.........


[8/23/2022 4:44 PM] birch0001
Tbh I don‚Äôt mind smurfs cuz I always play private‚Äôs with yall so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just prepared üòÇ


[8/23/2022 4:50 PM] otassin
i understand what's your point, from my point of view i don't consider to be about giving them space but assisting them, no matter how good they're sometimes they simply can't go to the ball, sometimes giving them too much space is bad because they will not consider you as a m8 and it will be a 1+1 Vs 2 (if that make sense lmao)


[8/23/2022 4:52 PM] otassin
and after you will have the ball, the boost and space to do something but because you allow your m8 to fully ballchase for 3minutes he will be surprise that suddenly you take the ball and not passing or leaving it to him


[8/23/2022 4:55 PM] say_grr
That space thing is on defense against your opponents, not your teammates.  If you opponents are smurfs, don't let them have any space to get down the field.  They have so many options on offense.

No.


[8/23/2022 5:04 PM] say_grr
With a M8 that is chasing, I wait for the popout/result.  Ball chasing teammates usually means more goals for me as 3rd man waiting for the mistakes/challenges that put the ball in a scorable location.

Ayyjayy already announced he was looking for other teams a couple days ago.


[8/24/2022 10:03 AM] icybutmelting
So far, Retals, Mist (linked with faze), Lj (linked with SSG), Ayyjayy, and Taroco are NAs hottest free agents


[8/24/2022 10:04 AM] lt_milkshake
Ayyjayy isn‚Äôt really a free agent tho, he‚Äôs on the bench as a sub. But it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll start him over a new player


[8/24/2022 10:06 AM] icybutmelting
Ayyjayy will def be looking to be bought out. Ayyjayy is literally top 10 NA. Only reason he‚Äôs benched is bc of his contract.

Team Vitality's future looks to be uncertain heading into #RLCS 2022-23.

- Radosin trying 3rds with both Alpha54 and Kaydop respectively. 
- ExoTiiK one of the tryouts. 
- Potential to stick.

guys... @DG iCy , i have an issue w my usb connections or somethiing and then i deleted some software, which i think made the situation worse, and i cannot figure out how to reinstall or make my usbs work or gain access to my other ports again like my headset will not reconnect cuz i think i deleted that drive for that port


[9/1/2022 12:58 PM] jdawg68
deleted intel 3.0 extensible controller host

[9/1/2022 12:59 PM] jdawg68
and my controller should support that? bc the other one i tried did not lol


[9/1/2022 12:59 PM] jdawg68
my pc i mean


[9/1/2022 1:00 PM] hoglishva
i assume, ive never deleted this before. what version of windows?


[9/1/2022 1:00 PM] jdawg68
not sure but i downloaded it


[9/1/2022 1:00 PM] jdawg68
idk what next but ill try to finish this lol


[9/1/2022 1:03 PM] jdawg68
i tried something and it failed n restart my pc lol so wont do that again ill keep trying


[9/1/2022 1:06 PM] icybutmelting
I honestly have no idea what to do here. Hopefully redownloading USB drivers or maybe even resetting your computer to default BIOS/factory settings might restore USB connectivity maybe?


[9/1/2022 1:07 PM] jdawg68
would that delete all my games and downloads?


[9/1/2022 1:07 PM] hoglishva
no


[9/1/2022 1:07 PM] hoglishva
bios is a mother board thing


[9/1/2022 1:07 PM] icybutmelting
I think it possibly could but idk‚Ä¶ but if you can‚Äôt ever use a USB again, it‚Äôs probably worth the reset as a last resort


[9/1/2022 1:08 PM] hoglishva
whats you motherboard and cpu?


[9/1/2022 1:08 PM] jdawg68
hog, after downloading the link u sent, what do i do after "opening file" to further complete the download?


[9/1/2022 1:08 PM] jdawg68
and how do i check?


[9/1/2022 1:10 PM] hoglishva
no sure lemme download it really quick i guess


[9/1/2022 1:10 PM] hoglishva
in a privat ematch sorry


[9/1/2022 1:11 PM] jdawg68
my major issue at hand is that i cannot use controller or headset from usbs, for some reason my mouse n keyboard are so idk whats going on lol, nor do i know what that thing is that i deleted


[9/1/2022 1:11 PM] jdawg68
so that could be a factor


[9/1/2022 1:11 PM] jdawg68
np srry for the inconvenience i am just lost tho lol


[9/1/2022 1:12 PM] hoglishva
its a .zip so you need winrar or 7zip to unpack it then there is a Setup.exe that you need to run


[9/1/2022 1:12 PM] hoglishva
naa youre good, after this match ill take a break to help


[9/1/2022 1:14 PM] jdawg68
so i need to install the winrar or 7zip before attempting to run the setup? or theres a chance i have those already?


[9/1/2022 1:14 PM] jdawg68
and ok bet


[9/1/2022 1:14 PM] hoglishva
right click and unpack or unzip


[9/1/2022 1:15 PM] hoglishva
extract files to folder or something


[9/1/2022 1:16 PM] jdawg68
so right click on "setup" then extract from there to a different folder?


[9/1/2022 1:16 PM] hoglishva
no you need everything extracted to work properly


[9/1/2022 1:17 PM] jdawg68
okay so extract from the entire folder titled ".....extensible host controller"?


[9/1/2022 1:18 PM] hoglishva
yes


[9/1/2022 1:18 PM] icybutmelting
Either way, your PS4controller USB wire was likely just old‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think changing anything on your PC‚Äôs side would‚Äôve helped with the disconnecting problem

[9/1/2022 1:18 PM] jdawg68
i mean i went and bought a new cable


[9/1/2022 1:18 PM] jdawg68
then it wasnt working so i tried fixing it thats y i have these issues lol


[9/1/2022 1:18 PM] hoglishva
it could be the port, does it work better on the port your head set is using?


[9/1/2022 1:19 PM] hoglishva
might need to use a usb hub to use everything going forward if it is lol


[9/1/2022 1:19 PM] jdawg68
the port that my headset is in isnt working now


[9/1/2022 1:19 PM] hoglishva
sorry i meant before the uninstall


[9/1/2022 1:19 PM] jdawg68
doesnt show up in devices


[9/1/2022 1:20 PM] jdawg68
ummm, id say my headset port was probs better but then again never had issues w either so idk


[9/1/2022 1:21 PM] jdawg68
i do have another port that doesnt work, i get power shortage alerts w that port, but no other


[9/1/2022 1:22 PM] hoglishva
did something happen recently to the computer. like a power outage or did a breaker get flipped?


[9/1/2022 1:22 PM] hoglishva
once youve ran the setup btw restart computer


[9/1/2022 1:23 PM] jdawg68
i havent ran anything yet


[9/1/2022 1:23 PM] jdawg68
i was waiting for confirmation lol


[9/1/2022 1:23 PM] hoglishva
oo shit sorry i missed it


[9/1/2022 1:23 PM] hoglishva
1 more time


[9/1/2022 1:23 PM] jdawg68
okay so extract from the entire folder titled ".....extensible host controller"?


[9/1/2022 1:24 PM] hoglishva
correct


[9/1/2022 1:24 PM] jdawg68
okay


[9/1/2022 1:24 PM] jdawg68
i extracted, now extract setup?


[9/1/2022 1:25 PM] hoglishva
it shouldnt need that, open the folder and setup should be in there.


[9/1/2022 1:25 PM] hoglishva
or maybe one folder in extra


[9/1/2022 1:26 PM] hoglishva
if you extract here then it should just be one folder, if you extracted to folder "Intel(R)_USB_3.0_eXtensible_Host_Controller_Driver_5.0.4.43_v2" then it probably created 1 extra folder deep


[9/1/2022 1:26 PM] jdawg68
yea, setup is in there, right click and extract that? or double left?


[9/1/2022 1:27 PM] hoglishva
double left click


[9/1/2022 1:27 PM] jdawg68
i get an alert, saying the operating system is not supported


[9/1/2022 1:27 PM] hoglishva
I wont run this sorftware cause i dont have intel and idk what it would do to my computer


[9/1/2022 1:27 PM] hoglishva
erm...


[9/1/2022 1:27 PM] hoglishva
windwos 7?


[9/1/2022 1:28 PM] jdawg68
how do i check


[9/1/2022 1:28 PM] jdawg68

[9/1/2022 1:28 PM] hoglishva

[9/1/2022 1:37 PM] .codyyy
like sometimes it‚Äôll be fine and work properly


[9/1/2022 1:37 PM] .codyyy
other times it‚Äôll turn the controller on and connect for 2 secs and just turn off


[9/1/2022 1:37 PM] .codyyy
and no matter what i do, reconnect them, restart my pc, nothing works till i try again in like 2 weeks

in dropshot 1year ago i reach GC2 at the end of the season but i didn't get the 10wins in gc before the end so no title for me

Joke's* on you every car is getting a new under glow variant. (jk idk)


[9/1/2022 1:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
honestly though. ranking those x-tra modes from best to worst would be
1 Rumble
2 Hoops
3 dropshot 
4 snowday


[9/1/2022 1:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but 1-4 doesnt really show how much i like each one so ill do from 1-100 where 100 is best and 1 is worst


[9/1/2022 1:56 PM] otassin
mines is 
1 Hoops
2 Dropshot
3 snowdays
4 Rumble


[9/1/2022 1:57 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
100 Rumble
80 Hoops 
60 Dropshot
50 Snowday


[9/1/2022 1:57 PM] otassin
for me rumble is the funniest mode in private match with friends, but actually grinding it nope


[9/1/2022 1:57 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Snowday is fun because of pinches but thats it for me'


[9/1/2022 1:57 PM] otassin
especially with randoms


[9/1/2022 1:58 PM] otassin
yeaaa


[9/1/2022 1:58 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Rumble gives u laughs untill u die sometimes and sometimes it just outright kills u


[9/1/2022 1:58 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and yeah randoms


[9/1/2022 1:58 PM] otassin
for me it should be a private mode


[9/1/2022 1:59 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but i still like it more than hoops


[9/1/2022 1:59 PM] otassin
when your in the fun vibes you can laught like 24/7

[9/1/2022 2:13 PM] trevlovespizza
They said they want to, but it wouldn‚Äôt be possible until the UE5 update releases as that engine can handle more, so just gotta wait at this point lol


[9/1/2022 2:21 PM] otassin
personnally i want heatseeker x)


[9/1/2022 2:29 PM] icybutmelting
The underglow will only be for the rocket pass car for season 8


[9/1/2022 2:30 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôll be a new parameter called ‚ÄúEdge Light,‚Äù and it will only be available for the Honda Civic Type-R and Honda Civic Type-R LE.


[9/1/2022 2:31 PM] icybutmelting
Heatseeker is still available for pvt matches, but having heatseeker be a perma cas playlist also makes sense

[9/1/2022 2:47 PM] hoglishva
What would the tags be? Predator vision?


[9/1/2022 2:49 PM] otassin
My only idea rn for title is 
GC : Ball seeker


[9/1/2022 2:49 PM] otassin
idk if its good


[9/1/2022 2:52 PM] hoglishva
maybe something to do with auto driving since the ball moves itself


[9/1/2022 2:55 PM] otassin
Calculater, learning, speed, redirect, follow, etc... those are some word si have in mind for finding a title

[9/2/2022 9:34 AM] icybutmelting
I def feel like I‚Äôm constantly sweating, even in pvt matches that don‚Äôt mean anything. A question that also might warrant further discussion is ‚Äúdoes a sweaty tryhard vibe make buds matches less fun?‚Äù


[9/2/2022 9:48 AM] say_grr
I got to admit, I play every match the same unless it's a special case.  I'm challenging everything and giving you as little space as possible.

What are everyones thoughts on solipsism


[9/6/2022 4:41 PM] birch0001
@DG iCy I wanna know what you think about it


[9/6/2022 4:41 PM] icybutmelting
bro i dont even know what that word means


[9/6/2022 4:55 PM] birch0001
the view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.


[9/6/2022 4:56 PM] icybutmelting
I don't really care for philosophy, sadge. Sounds cool but I can't even begin to grasp wtf that even implies


[9/6/2022 5:16 PM] birch0001
It is almost like you know your real but don‚Äôt know how to prove everything else is real idk I haven‚Äôt gone to deep into it but it is really interesting


[9/6/2022 5:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Ig evryone is still grinding for last minute ranks ?


[9/6/2022 5:34 PM] prototypebabies
i dont believe it, that implies faith is not a human sense.


[9/6/2022 5:38 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so like everything around u is ur imagination and nothing is real?


[9/6/2022 5:40 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i feel like, we dont really know anything about anything, but that in time all things will be revealed


[9/6/2022 5:41 PM] prototypebabies
even if everything was nothing like when spongebob traveled too far into the future that still wouldnt change when it was something it made you.


[9/6/2022 5:41 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i just said we dont know much


[9/6/2022 5:42 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
theres so much knowledge in the universe, its endless and we only know a really small fraction of that knowledge


[9/6/2022 5:43 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like if the knowledge we have as humans was at the cellular level and then 1 million times 1 million smaller than that


[9/6/2022 5:43 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
and then some


[9/6/2022 6:14 PM] birch0001
I didn‚Äôt explain it to well

Oh nah, it‚Äôs fine. I thought you were asking abt the text itself


[9/12/2022 1:26 PM] lt_milkshake
I definitely like the second one best IMO


[9/12/2022 1:28 PM] hoglishva
I like third with no background, maybe 1 or half a font larger?


[9/12/2022 2:09 PM] birch0001
I agree


[9/12/2022 4:01 PM] icybutmelting
Assuming the outline box is not there, I think 1 is the best, followed by 3. The font of 2 seems weak, and the black box of 4 is just ugly


[9/12/2022 4:01 PM] icybutmelting
1 with a slightly larger font would slap ngl


[9/12/2022 4:01 PM] otassin
oukay thx


[9/12/2022 4:02 PM] lt_milkshake
You like when letters have a different colored outline @DG iCy ?


[9/12/2022 4:08 PM] icybutmelting
Yes? Isn‚Äôt that common? White outlined with black to make the white pop?


[9/12/2022 4:09 PM] icybutmelting
Otherwise, the white is just weak on its own


[9/12/2022 4:09 PM] lt_milkshake
Idk if it common or not. I was just asking out of curiosity

I think the timeout in Looking to Play was def the correct decision. Really smart for those who don‚Äôt wanna read through a wall of text to see when ppl are getting on. Editing messages works around it if there‚Äôs anything that needs to be said there

i did warn yall


[9/19/2022 2:45 PM] say_grr
Use the general unless you are specifically asking to play.  For some of us, it's the only thing we have set to notify.


[9/19/2022 2:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
^^^^


[9/19/2022 2:46 PM] lt_milkshake
Originally it was 15 tho which was ok, 30 mins is excessive


[9/19/2022 2:46 PM] lt_milkshake
The notification part is on ya‚Äôll


[9/19/2022 2:46 PM] trevlovespizza
It was 2 initially, never 15. Switched right to 30


[9/19/2022 2:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it was 16 sry


[9/19/2022 2:47 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
or something close to 15

[9/19/2022 2:48 PM] say_grr
He just said 30 was the only thing other than 2 minutes


[9/19/2022 2:48 PM] trevlovespizza
It was 2 minutes and then 30 minutes


[9/19/2022 2:48 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it was a slowmode of more thn 15 min is the point


[9/19/2022 2:49 PM] lt_milkshake
Still, if I ask someone to play, and they say yes, I can‚Äôt tell them to either join gen chat or the fact that I might not be on right away for 30 minutes. That‚Äôs just too long


[9/19/2022 2:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
maybe i was mistaken, but i lookedat the slowmode timer and it was at 15


[9/19/2022 2:49 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Trev fault there, ig dm or @ in gen?


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
most people use the gen chat to call others either way


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
not me but


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs supposed to be the whole pound of lfg chat tho, that we don‚Äôt have to clutter gen with asking others to play


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, be more concise I guess. Not really my issue, I‚Äôm just getting tired by LTP being completed filled with messages and it needed to be changed


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] say_grr
I just send them a message


[9/19/2022 2:50 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
change ur notifications to only @

[9/19/2022 2:51 PM] trevlovespizza
I don‚Äôt even have notifications on for anything on discord


[9/19/2022 2:51 PM] lt_milkshake
I agree, but I think 30 is excessive, I feel like something ~5-10 is fine


[9/19/2022 2:51 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[9/19/2022 2:51 PM] trevlovespizza
@CrazyWiz_26 let me know if that role worked and gave you access to #rlcs. I haven‚Äôt used that bot in a while and gotta double check


[9/19/2022 2:52 PM] say_grr
I've seen it happen, someone mentions they want to play, then the chat gets spammed and when someone looks at it, they don't know anyone wants to play unless they scroll back and read all the spam

ik how to work it


[9/19/2022 2:53 PM] trevlovespizza
People don‚Äôt necessarily reply instantly, it takes a few minutes typically at least. 5-10 isn‚Äôt really helping matters though it‚Äôs the same thing. 30 is the only thing that stops it (mostly)


[9/19/2022 2:53 PM] trevlovespizza

Bit of a deep thought but think of the ambitions and dreams you had when you were a little kid growing up and look at where you are currently mentally, physically, career wise‚Ä¶ and ask yourself would you be proud of where your at right now.?!

Genuinely curious for everyone‚Äôs answers


[9/20/2022 4:18 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im still a kid so...

From childhood though, ive always liked electricity, and things around that. Today im wayyy better at computer stuff. and i ve fixed a bunch of little stuffs. Ive fixed an old laptop so that it worked, ive completely swaped a whole laptop into another (all the electrical components into a newer casing), fixed up a joycon, when i had the xbox i figured out what caused it to overheat and shutdown, and i fixed it. I fixed our refrigerator, ive changed car tires and oil.

It is crazy!  Some people even spent the time to build some really cool ones in the game.  The second image you shared is actually from the game as well, lol.  It's the start menu background.


[9/22/2022 8:37 PM] say_grr
Just because of the amount of resources and scale, I don't think it's the best option for our peak.  Portability is important considering it's a finite resource!


[9/22/2022 9:38 PM] icybutmelting
NO WAY LOL


[9/22/2022 9:39 PM] icybutmelting
The theory is that we can harvest most of the materials from asteroids or something. I bet you‚Äôre gonna tell me that‚Äôs also a part of the game lol


[9/22/2022 9:52 PM] say_grr
No, in the game you just harvest it from all the other planets around all the solar systems.  This is my home planet doing all the production of the resources gathered from other systems.

[9/26/2022 3:40 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
really no point in using looking to play


[9/26/2022 4:09 PM] trevlovespizza
Then don‚Äôt use it. Not my problem


[9/26/2022 4:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i wasnt finished


[9/26/2022 4:09 PM] lt_milkshake
Kinda is. Being server owner and all


[9/26/2022 4:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
no point in using it, unless ur calling people


[9/26/2022 4:10 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
which u could do in gen ig


[9/26/2022 4:10 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ig its for @ ing people


[9/26/2022 4:10 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
idk


[9/26/2022 4:11 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what was ur purpose for #deleted-channel @Trev p.s. i wasnt trying to be rude at all or anything


[9/26/2022 4:11 PM] trevlovespizza
If people didn‚Äôt have full conversations in LTP then it wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue.


[9/26/2022 4:11 PM] lt_milkshake
Then tell ppl you see doing it to stop or they‚Äôll get muted or some


[9/26/2022 4:12 PM] trevlovespizza
@.J you‚Äôre good dude. I get what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs typically used to let people know you‚Äôre looking to play. If conversations were cut out that weren‚Äôt related to actually looking to play, I‚Äôm more than happy getting rid of it.


[9/26/2022 4:12 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah thats a problem sometimes


[9/26/2022 4:13 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
usually its when icy says,"be on in 5" or something, and then someone (maybe me) would say,"years" and then a whole conv happens


[9/26/2022 4:14 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im not a fan of the cluttering/unorganized chats.


[9/26/2022 4:14 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it just happens though


[9/26/2022 4:38 PM] icybutmelting
Big fax I found it annoying tok tbh


[9/26/2022 4:39 PM] icybutmelting
Which is why the timeouts actually just solve the problem at hand?


[9/26/2022 4:39 PM] icybutmelting
It makes sense, especially for members that don‚Äôt normally want to read the daily 100 or so messages this server puts out


[9/26/2022 5:19 PM] birch0001

Building this huge Dyson sphere is a killer on my 1080 TI!  Even with it set not to draw the sphere, I'm still using 100% of it!

Time for computer upgrade????


[10/1/2022 9:38 AM] say_grr
Nah, the game just needs to be coded a little better.  I can run just about anything with this.  And even running at 99%/100% it's running pretty well in game with no noticeable lag.


[10/1/2022 9:40 AM] say_grr
I was able to run both Dyson and RL with Rl running at 165 FPS no problem and no lag there!  I thought it was both causing my GPU to run full blast.  Never noticed or checked it before building this huge dyson sphere.


[10/1/2022 9:45 AM] say_grr
Dyson has it's own in game monitor......  Running at over 60 UPS (updates per second, similar to FPS but backend not drawing).  The game runs smoothly, but the GPU is always maxed out!

More surprisingly, Falcons lost the first MENA regional to KRN (Rw9, Kiileerrz, and Nadr). KRN was supposed to have Nwpo (a top 5 talent in the world imo), but Nwpo got banned. They signed a random up and coming player in Nadr and still destroyed Falcons


[10/8/2022 3:41 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
oof


[10/8/2022 3:42 PM] icybutmelting
If Nwpo didn‚Äôt get banned, KRN would probably have been world contenders

[10/8/2022 4:54 PM] icybutmelting
The only goal in that list that‚Äôs not realistic is the SSL by august


[10/8/2022 4:55 PM] icybutmelting
The difference between GC2 and SSL is probably similar to the difference between plat 1 and GC1


[10/8/2022 4:55 PM] icybutmelting
At least when it comes to the amount of time, effort, and improvement it takes to reach those gaps


[10/8/2022 4:56 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs a common notion that the amount of effort it takes to get from Bronze 1 to GC1 is similar to what it takes to get from GC1 to SSL

are people spamming in this salon ? üßê


[10/8/2022 7:39 PM] say_grr
It's just to keep the spam out of looking to play.  No limits on other channels


[10/8/2022 7:40 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Grr8fully


[10/8/2022 7:40 PM] say_grr
Not really spam, but if someone types they are looking to play, then somone jumps on tha start conversating in the looking to play chat, anyone that checks it has to scan through all that bs to find out who's looking to play


[10/8/2022 7:41 PM] otassin
imagine asking 
-someone wanna play ?
-Yes, what gamemode ?
(wait 30minutes)
-2S ? 
(player 2 left the chat)

what if other people answer the message or say unrelated thing after this message you expect the person to look at previous message each time ?

gen chat


[10/8/2022 7:44 PM] otassin
theyre just no justification, remove the salon will be better, im gonna ask for play here, don't care about the #deleted-channel anymore


[10/8/2022 7:44 PM] say_grr
Well, at least they can only answer once every 30 minutes......


[10/8/2022 7:45 PM] otassin
yay i have the time to do 4 matchs for waiting an answer, worse than windows maj lmao


[10/8/2022 7:46 PM] say_grr
The other option would be to get rid of looking to play and just using the looking to play role and having you tag it to notify people you are looking.


[10/8/2022 7:47 PM] otassin
you really want to put an role and remove it each time you looking for players or no ?


[10/8/2022 7:47 PM] otassin
personnaly i just ask and if someone invite me or answer im happy


[10/8/2022 7:48 PM] otassin
that a wierd mecanics to do, 10 times worses for people who just got here


[10/8/2022 7:49 PM] say_grr
Not really, but we're just trying to keep looking to play as a one message per person area where we won't have to scan much to see the latest people looking.


[10/8/2022 7:49 PM] otassin
well im just gonna ask here x)


[10/8/2022 7:50 PM] say_grr
That works too.  But as you can see, it can get buried really quick after just a few minutes of people chatting....


[10/8/2022 7:52 PM] otassin
yea i understand the logic but i still find it weird, if i look for playing im lookign every match in discord for a little moment and thats it, its not that busy in tchat


[10/8/2022 7:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
refer to this^^^^^^^^


[10/8/2022 7:53 PM] say_grr
It doesn't always happen, but sometimes the discussions people have deciding what game mode they want to play can "spam" the chat similar to our last 10 minutes


[10/8/2022 7:54 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
just click the message i replied to to see the whole convo


[10/8/2022 7:55 PM] say_grr
And people like me have all discord notifications off except the looking to play one.  Now I just get a notification every time someone is looking to play, not everytime they talk about the mode they want to play


[10/8/2022 7:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah i had to mute the 6mans channel


[10/8/2022 7:57 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so many people texting was irritating

I don‚Äôt think there was a discussion in this server about this: how do y‚Äôall feel about how all those freestylers getting banned for smurfing in casual?


[10/11/2022 6:13 PM] nebula1157
It‚Äôs dumb, since it is casual


[10/11/2022 6:13 PM] icybutmelting
Long story short, many freestylers would drop all the way to negative MMRs so they could clip on bronzes, basically, but they still got banned for it


[10/11/2022 6:14 PM] icybutmelting
Either way, shoutout to players like Evample and Henkovic. Being a ‚Äúcomp freestyler‚Äù is insane‚Ä¶ they make other SSLs look like bronzes lol


[10/11/2022 6:19 PM] trevlovespizza
Absolutely not dumb Nebula. 

Imagine just starting the game out, or even playing for months/years and just not being too good at it. Now imagine freestylers doing whatever they want while you sit there and waste your time. Or the freestylers that send it to OT intentionally and never let the game end. That‚Äôs just not fair.


[10/11/2022 6:20 PM] nebula1157
That does makes sense, what about a freestyle playlist for those players who want to freestyle


[10/11/2022 6:21 PM] lt_milkshake
That makes even less sense, cuz with that logic there should be a perma playlist for all type of playstyle


[10/11/2022 6:21 PM] trevlovespizza
It‚Äôs called private games. Go freestyle on your buddies while they let you. It‚Äôs the same as smurfing since they can‚Äôt stop it


[10/11/2022 6:21 PM] lt_milkshake
Demo, Sit in net, Ballchase, Etc.


[10/11/2022 6:22 PM] nebula1157
Freestyling isn‚Äôt a play style


[10/11/2022 6:22 PM] trevlovespizza
Yes it is


[10/11/2022 6:23 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah it is


[10/11/2022 6:23 PM] icybutmelting
Yessirrry it do be


[10/11/2022 6:23 PM] nebula1157
Oh ok


[10/11/2022 6:23 PM] nebula1157
It is not a conventional play style, and can only be done in certain conditions


[10/11/2022 6:24 PM] icybutmelting
Someone in the SRSE mentioned that there could be a H.O.R.S.E. game mode/playlist. While that would be really cool, it sounds like a nightmare to code


[10/11/2022 6:24 PM] nebula1157
That would be cool, but fax


[10/11/2022 6:24 PM] lt_milkshake
WRONG, you can go for freestyles in literally any condition. It just may not work well in certain circumstances


[10/11/2022 6:25 PM] trevlovespizza
Even 2K said they tried adding a HORSE mode into an older game and it wouldn‚Äôt work out and that‚Äôs with very limited scripted simulations. I can imagine how hard it would be on RL lol


[10/11/2022 6:25 PM] nebula1157
There is a difference in freestyling and just making an aireal play


[10/11/2022 6:25 PM] trevlovespizza
Obviously


[10/11/2022 6:26 PM] lt_milkshake
Well no shit


[10/11/2022 6:26 PM] icybutmelting
I think freestyler is definitely a playstyle, even in the most traditional sense of the word. Freestylers never shoot, never give up possession, only attempt clips, etc.

It‚Äôs a whole set of habits, similar to how ‚Äúballchasing‚Äù is a playstyle, right?


[10/11/2022 6:26 PM] lt_milkshake
Damn right


[10/11/2022 6:26 PM] icybutmelting
Like watch a pulse fire vid and see how he treats a game. That‚Äôs a whole playstyle lol

Song made from only mayonnaise.
I hope that the quality of this channel is evened out now from all the yeah boy videos.

Animated footage belongs to Nickelodeon/Viacom but is used within fair use. Everything else was produced by me.

[11/3/2022 9:07 PM] hoglishva
@Blissard https://pcpartpicker.com/
Use this you'll find better prices. 
If it was a gsync monitor the price would make more sense, I think it being curved is jacking the price up.
 Try to visit a local best buy and check out a curved monitor I personally think they are memes.

The CPU cooler for sure is bad.  Try to get something with a bit more metal fins and possibly 1 or 2 more heat pipes (the copper pipe looking thing)
This is cheaper and bigger plus you can put 2 extra fans on it if you get more of the mounts. https://pcpartpicker.com/product/c3pzK8/thermalright-silver-soul-135-82-cfm-cpu-cooler-ss135

Any QHD with either Gsync or Freesync at 32 inches is going to be $300 plus......  Mine is 27 inches and it was over $400 new.  QHD with 150+ refresh rate is not cheap!


[11/3/2022 9:16 PM] hoglishva
Freesync isn't paywalled like gsync, you can get one for 240$ at 32" or 170$ at a more reasonable 27"


[11/3/2022 9:21 PM] hoglishva
@Blissard 60hz is "just fine" 75hz is "recommended" 144hz is "ideal" and anything more at 1440 you'll want more than a 3060 ti to even reach those FPS on high or ultra on "some" games.


[11/3/2022 10:04 PM] blissfury
If you look at their website most of Canada computers monitors are around the price of the one I posted maybe as low as 260 for a 27" I didn't spend a long time looking currently not worried about it too much, everything on the list was recommended by the tech guy for what I best described I needed. Probably will get a monitor from best buy because I gonna have store credit there. I haven't looked at the silver soul (I assume that's the fan you're suggesting) but me looking for something with metal fins  and metal pipes I don't know where I'd find this info or what it would look like. I appreciate the help though


[11/3/2022 10:06 PM] blissfury
Also I'm looking at having a monitor and other parts that will allow me to upgrade in the future


[11/3/2022 10:06 PM] hoglishva
Ooo shid CAD not USD, I forgot you you were canadian :( prices are gonna sound fucked to me then


[11/3/2022 10:08 PM] blissfury
That monitor is like 240 usd


[11/3/2022 11:09 PM] say_grr
When it comes to monitors, you really want to research the quality of them as well as the specs and compare them to others with the same specs.  2 different companies making the same spec monitors will result in different outcomes.


[11/3/2022 11:10 PM] blissfury
Well I'm looking to buy within the next 2 weeks hopefully so I got some time to look around


[11/3/2022 11:14 PM] say_grr
Sometimes a quick youtube search for something like 31" QHD monitor review for all 31" QHD.  This will have 60hz monitors, but really nice quality.  Add freesync or Gsync, depending on your Graphics card(the one you have selected is (GSync compatible)) and it should have a few reviews for them.  There aren't that many companies/variations out there once you know the size, hz, and gsync/freesync capabilities

But on a real note, from my knowledge, the main differences between companies that may have the same spec is things like how well the color comes across, it‚Äôs true black point and things like that

Sorry this is late.  Yeah they are a little different.  The LG models are known for white light leaking around the edges of the screen on some models and the MSI is known for dead pixels.  But out of all the monitors, they are some of the best visual quality.  I have an MSI MAG274QRF that I use daily.  I also have a VG sitting in a box right now waiting to be set up as a second monitor.

[11/9/2022 12:19 AM] kenryth
Unreal engine 5 maybe?


[11/9/2022 12:19 AM] say_grr
Nooooooo.  Just a server maintenance, no update


[11/9/2022 12:20 AM] say_grr
UE5 will be a huge update we'll know about!


[11/9/2022 12:20 AM] kenryth
Lol. Ya. I know. We are probably like 2 years + away from ue5 lol


[11/9/2022 12:21 AM] trevlovespizza
I think UE5 will release around March/April. I think we‚Äôll start seeing info around January for it


[11/9/2022 12:22 AM] kenryth
If I‚Äôm being honest I only will be excited about it if it allows console to have rings maps


[11/9/2022 12:22 AM] kenryth
And I‚Äôm more afraid of switch not working anymore lol


[11/9/2022 12:24 AM] trevlovespizza
It‚Äôll be better optimized so hopefully Switch will run better than UE3 

I don‚Äôt see hoops maps on console though for a while, if ever.


[11/9/2022 12:24 AM] say_grr
It should be compatible, UE5 makes cross platform easy.


[11/9/2022 12:25 AM] kenryth
But there‚Äôs a chance that ue5 causes epic to allow user made maps like they have in FortNite. Then it would be available for console


[11/9/2022 12:27 AM] trevlovespizza
If they‚Äôre official maps, yes. But if they‚Äôre unofficial, it would typically be up to the console if they‚Äôll allow it. I know PS is *very* limiting with games that allows ‚Äúmods‚Äù, but Xbox is more open to it


[11/9/2022 12:27 AM] say_grr
It's already possible under UE3, but they haven't done it for a few reasons.


[11/9/2022 12:27 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
exactly


[11/9/2022 12:27 AM] kenryth
Do any of those reasons get eliminated with ue5?


[11/9/2022 12:28 AM] say_grr
The creators of rocket league have stated the reason they limit the amount of different game modes is to keep them full, que's short.......


[11/9/2022 12:28 AM] kenryth
But this is just freeplay maps‚Ä¶


[11/9/2022 12:29 AM] kenryth
All queues empty cause 300,000 players are spinning in circles flying through rings. Lol


[11/9/2022 12:29 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
thats actually fairly smart, if there were too many game modes and RL's current pop, then disaster


[11/9/2022 12:29 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but for me, i just want rings maps or dribble maps


[11/9/2022 12:30 AM] say_grr
The thing with a lot of console exports is adding custom maps on top of that is console restricted to an extent and they have to program for each console ways to get through it.......  Lots of work that will cause bugs if not done properly.


[11/9/2022 12:31 AM] kenryth
@Hydra is just rocking it in that comp 2s chat


[11/9/2022 12:32 AM] kenryth

Its not bad, its actually cheaper then building your own: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6Y8Y78
Just look up on youtube "i7-11700 rtx 3060 1080 benchmark" or if you play at a larger resolution 1440 or 2160. You should find tons of videos with people playing multiple games with the setup.

You can thank Hog for that, he's been wanting it for a while lol


[11/15/2022 5:45 PM] icybutmelting
Also Jay ur so dramatic XD


[11/15/2022 5:46 PM] lt_milkshake
So with this remodel are we branching out more from RL?


[11/15/2022 5:46 PM] lt_milkshake
Since theirs tags for different games now and the server name no longer has rl in it


[11/15/2022 5:48 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, for sure


[11/15/2022 5:48 PM] lt_milkshake

[11/15/2022 6:18 PM] lt_milkshake
So with this redesign, are we gonna get our RL rank roles back or no? Since we‚Äôre becoming less ‚Äúonly rl‚Äù


[11/15/2022 6:18 PM] lt_milkshake
Personally I‚Äôm fine with keeping them gone


[11/15/2022 6:20 PM] nebula1157
ummmm, why did you delete the clips and highlights channel? didn't that delete our clips?


[11/15/2022 6:22 PM] trevlovespizza
@CrazyWiz_26 - All the RL ranks will be back, but will be set up under RL roles, not the main roles


[11/15/2022 6:22 PM] trevlovespizza
@Nebula Yes, all deleted


[11/15/2022 6:22 PM] nebula1157
bruh


[11/15/2022 6:22 PM] nebula1157
why


[11/15/2022 6:22 PM] trevlovespizza
Because you can't clip anyways


[11/15/2022 6:23 PM] nebula1157
üò¶


[11/15/2022 6:23 PM] trevlovespizza
Just kidding though, didn't delete the RL channels, just hidden for now until you have the RL role


[11/15/2022 6:23 PM] nebula1157
ahhh ok


[11/15/2022 6:23 PM] trevlovespizza
Which should be active in about....5 minutes


[11/15/2022 6:24 PM] trevlovespizza
Just so if we say get new members from NMS and they don't care about RL, they're not stuck having it on their feed, you know? vice versa yada yada


[11/15/2022 6:24 PM] trevlovespizza
Choose the games you want, access those channels you want

Yes, they're going to be set up different though. 
They're not going to be permanent.


[11/15/2022 6:33 PM] lt_milkshake
Why not just make them permanent in the RL tab?

Alright, so there's a lot of new things here + a lot more to come. 

*Make sure to choose your #roles to access the full server (Also I have some RL roles back over at #deleted-channel )
*There's a leveling system now which you can access with /Level 
* #suggestions - Wanna suggest anything to change? Add new games? Use /suggest command
* #buds-tournaments is getting a full makeover to be a bit more aesthetically pleasing
* #live-on-twitch is fixed - If you're not in the system, just let me know and I can change that
* There's no more permanent RL comp voice channels. Our new system is a bit more clean and very straight-forward. 
Join the +New Channel VC to start the set up. Any questions with that ask me, or some of the other buds can help you!
*Giveaways coming soon
*Weekly tournaments w/ prizes


I think that's basically everything that's set for now, any questions/comments, I'm around.

@JohnGoClutch Click it once, if you click it again it'll remove it. 
Once you have the role, the whole Rocket League category will appear and all sub channels will be available to you!

This mech is the future


[11/18/2022 8:31 AM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, I think it‚Äôll be one of those mechs that people do a lot for a few months but then it dies back down for a year or two until a pro randomly does a huge play with it


[11/18/2022 8:32 AM] lt_milkshake
Kinda like that infinite jump off the wall ‚Äúglitch‚Äù


[11/18/2022 9:29 AM] trevlovespizza
RLCS chat is still a thing. It‚Äôs just a hidden channel until I figure out the issue with it


[11/18/2022 9:50 AM] icybutmelting
The main difference is that a Lix jump is an extremely hard mechanic, while zap dashing is easy to implement for anyone Diamond+. It's even easier than walldashing, so I think it'll be very common within a month or so


[11/18/2022 9:51 AM] icybutmelting
Funny thing is, this mech isn't new at all, but it only became popular after aZapatos used it religiously to clap NA 1v1 players during Rizzo's tournament


[11/18/2022 9:52 AM] icybutmelting

idk laptops that well but yeah it seems good. good god it has a 4k screen to.

It'll probably have heat issues and throttle


[11/24/2022 2:50 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, if you were compare it to actual pcs, you could get something much better for the og price of 2k but that for 1200 doesn‚Äôt seem absolutely horrible. Like hog idk much abt laptops, so I‚Äôd definitely say look into other options yourself or via yt and compare the price with the parts

As someone who has both a gaming laptop and pc. A gaming laptop is nice if you're traveling around a decent bit and when you're home you can hook it up to a monitor with a high refresh rate and you essentially have a gaming setup at your desk. With a PC build ofc you get better performance (depending on what specs you get) but ofc the con is less desk space and no portability. imo i would get a gaming laptop with a 144hz or 240hz monitor. Check out the HP Omen 15, this is the laptop i have. Its slightly more than the laptop you posted but the HP Omen gives you that juicy 300hz refresh rate

Was researching some smartwatches on sale right now.  While watching this video, I see this...  Got to get it now.  This is a pretty sweet deal as well.  It's the galaxy watch 4 classic, the bigger one!  It's on sale right now for $150!  Plus, my 20 year old casio data watch needs replaced, lol

This might sound really toxic of me, but I hate playing in pvt matches these days.


[12/4/2022 1:43 AM] icybutmelting
Y'all dont tryhard enough


[12/4/2022 1:43 AM] icybutmelting
I'd rather constantly sweat and try to improve tbh


[12/4/2022 1:43 AM] icybutmelting
Which I shouldn't force on people, to be fair


[12/4/2022 1:43 AM] nebula1157
That's a fair opinion


[12/4/2022 1:44 AM] icybutmelting
So I'll instead avoid playing in them

Also, for the mouse, I don‚Äôt need anything special right? The one I have is just a functional wireless mouse. Not a gaming mouse. But I don‚Äôt plan to play kbk ever on any game

old school runescape, Dayz, ark survival evolved, satisfactory, garys mods, dungeon defenders, rust, scum, war thunder, halo master cheif collection, modded minecraft, borderlands, no mans sky, tabletop simulator, astroneer, golf it/golf with your friends.

Cause if you had a tw octane right now you couldn‚Äôt make profit you would have lost half of what you put into your octane.

Is it suggested to get a Cat 6 ethernet cable?


[12/13/2022 2:25 PM] say_grr
Less interference and higher bandwidth is always a good thing.   If you can afford the upgrade........


[12/13/2022 2:26 PM] say_grr
Most of the time cat5e is good enough and you won't notice a difference.   But if there's interference it might be a life saver to upgrade

Just to test and get it running


[12/13/2022 2:37 PM] say_grr
It's twice the price per foot for cat6 vs cat5e, but the bandwidth and less loss overt long lengths makes it worth it if you want the cleanest fastest connection possible.   But if your internet isn't fast enough, or there is no interference,  it's overkill........  If you are connecting to a router/ server with shared files, it might make a difference there.

I moved into my girlfriends place, I don‚Äôt use wired connection anymore so I just get random lag spikes, but at my grandmas house I was wired and that‚Äôs when I had that slight delay for almost a whole, was it because of the cable or was it my pc? (I didn‚Äôt turn on my pc for like 2 weeks before yesterday)

[12/19/2022 1:47 AM] .codyyy
Well it does. But I wonder if it actually improves it more because of it, like does only level 1, mean regardless what you stream at, it won‚Äôt be as smooth looking unless you level up your server?

But it's cool, I'm watching ep 11 of Chainsaw man


[12/23/2022 3:00 PM] icybutmelting
It‚Äôs lowkey sad bc there‚Äôs only 12 episodes this season, and honestly, the arc they cover was hella boring. Nothing happened all season


[12/23/2022 3:01 PM] icybutmelting
The leaks that they‚Äôd adapt 25 episodes was major cap üò¶


[12/23/2022 7:51 PM] blissfury
I enjoyed all of it

[12/24/2022 3:30 PM] .codyyy
@Grr8-_-Ness I have a psn card, if I bought it on my acc on ps, would I be able to use it on pc too??


[12/24/2022 3:30 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ye


[12/24/2022 3:30 PM] .codyyy
Since they‚Äôre linked


[12/24/2022 3:30 PM] .codyyy
OUUUU


[12/24/2022 3:30 PM] .codyyy
bet


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] say_grr
If your PSN is set as your main


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] .codyyy
It is


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] .codyyy
Ohh wait


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
for reassurance my main linked is xbox, but since i hv no xbox i use the switch and everything comes to me


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] say_grr
I just went and bought it on my PS because I still have credits from last X-Mas


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] .codyyy
I‚Äôm not sure


[12/24/2022 3:31 PM] say_grr
And I'm using it right now on my PC.  But I have My PSN as my main


[12/24/2022 3:32 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like all my progress was from xbox and using the rl account linker im able to gain drops on my switch and stuff


[12/24/2022 3:32 PM] say_grr
But If I get something like iCy traded me a decal on PC and I can't use it on my PSN


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] say_grr
That's why I always switch my PS on to buy something for my main account


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ho


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
it doesnt work for me like that


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
interesting


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] .codyyy
I think epic games is my main


[12/24/2022 3:33 PM] .codyyy
I‚Äôm not sure


[12/24/2022 3:34 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i know for facts my main is xbox, but i do everything on switch and no problems


[12/24/2022 3:36 PM] say_grr
I'm not sure about things bought in the store, but for traded things, it happens for me.  The forest green Dune Racer decal doesn't show up on my PS when I turn it on and switch to that car.


[12/24/2022 3:36 PM] say_grr
It's the one I got from iCy


[12/24/2022 3:37 PM] say_grr
That's the way it was explained as well when they first started free to play


[12/24/2022 3:42 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
switch = just better


[12/24/2022 4:20 PM] .codyyy
I‚Äôll probably do some research on it


[12/24/2022 4:24 PM] .codyyy

[12/24/2022 10:08 PM] .codyyy
I used to


[12/24/2022 10:08 PM] trevlovespizza

[12/24/2022 10:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Profits though


[12/24/2022 10:09 PM] .codyyy
True


[12/24/2022 10:09 PM] .codyyy

[12/24/2022 10:09 PM] trevlovespizza

[12/24/2022 10:10 PM] .codyyy

Whats that one website where u guys buy creds


[12/26/2022 2:03 PM] lt_milkshake
Uhh, I think we all just buy credits straight from rocket league


[12/26/2022 2:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
no i know that, but ik that some buy their creds from Aoeah.com for cheaper or something like that


[12/26/2022 2:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like .73 cents for 100cr


[12/26/2022 2:04 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
3.43 for 500


[12/26/2022 2:04 PM] lt_milkshake
Oh, I personally don‚Äôt trust that shit


[12/26/2022 2:05 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
same


[12/26/2022 2:05 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
just was wondering which these guys trusted, but im gonna stick to trading


[12/26/2022 4:55 PM] icybutmelting
Absolutely not, epic and psyonix are scam artists


[12/26/2022 4:56 PM] icybutmelting
AOEAH and Lolga are pretty trustworthy and credits are 50% off that way


[12/26/2022 4:57 PM] icybutmelting
I personally use AOEAH. Also, only ever buy credits, because items are severely overpriced on those sites


[12/26/2022 4:57 PM] icybutmelting
Instead of using my card, I use PayPal tho.


[12/26/2022 4:58 PM] icybutmelting
Oh and if you‚Äôre under 18, stick to buying from psyonix actually


[12/26/2022 4:58 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[12/26/2022 5:00 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
is there a specific reason?


[12/26/2022 5:02 PM] icybutmelting
Cuz you don‚Äôt have your own credit card or financial accounts like PayPal


[12/26/2022 5:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
cash app


[12/26/2022 5:03 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
?


[12/26/2022 5:03 PM] icybutmelting
You can‚Äôt use that to buy credits on those websites


[12/26/2022 5:08 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[12/29/2022 11:00 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
wdym? why dont we do it the same way we would do 3s takeover. We have some find the match and then we have people join upinto the match.


[12/29/2022 11:00 AM] .codyyy
I believe it won‚Äôt allow you to do it that way


[12/29/2022 11:01 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[12/29/2022 1:50 PM] kenryth
Ya I think it might let you queue with 8


[12/29/2022 1:50 PM] kenryth
The limit is only 4 normally because other modes are limited to 4


[12/29/2022 1:50 PM] kenryth
Hopefully they expanded to 8 for knockout

@ÔΩìÔΩâÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩíÔΩÅ @.J @Nebula Im 80% we took over a lobby or we where 6 out of the 8 people at least. @Tippie2829 @Trev and @Grr8-_-Ness you where there im pretty sure.


[12/29/2022 4:51 PM] icybutmelting
Yeah, but they updated it so it's extremely difficult to do so now. Sadly, you can only queue 4 into a lobby, and they eliminated the "join party match" option


[12/29/2022 4:52 PM] icybutmelting
I think we can queue into each other if we are lucky


[12/29/2022 4:52 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

where?


[1/2/2023 1:55 AM] trevlovespizza
Under RL #deleted-channel
Figured people would see it when adding their rank.


[1/2/2023 1:57 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
huh, thats not really a place id think a role would be. I looked in rules and roles for the rlcs role


[1/2/2023 1:57 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
but ig


[1/2/2023 2:13 AM] trevlovespizza
I didn‚Äôt want to create an entire Rocket League channel devoted to roles only for that one role, as well as not put it in actual #roles because it‚Äôs a sub of RL.


[1/2/2023 2:16 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i get that, just an unexpected place thats all

[1/9/2023 12:56 AM] lt_milkshake
I don‚Äôt even understand why I got placed so low, I finished in c3 and won 4/10 games due to smurfs

u hv the extra mmr from doing placements and everyone is about in their supposed to be rank

according to hog in 2s i was 600mmr which is like silver


[1/9/2023 1:08 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
now im to the point where 1 more win puts me in c3 in 2s


[1/9/2023 1:08 AM] lt_milkshake
Oh damn


[1/9/2023 1:08 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im still getting the xtra mmr


[1/9/2023 1:08 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
same with 1s i went straight from d1 to c1 in just a few hours like 2


[1/9/2023 1:10 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
my point being if when the ranks reset we wait for at least 2-3weeks before doing placements, when we do decide to do them we hv less of a chance of facing smurfs because everyone would mostly be in their reg rank. So we get dubs plus xtra mmr.

We should change that real soon. 
I‚Äôve been playing console and it‚Äôs still stuck in like A15. Found out my laptop can run it with graphics that look basically what it does on console so that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing lol


[1/9/2023 8:51 PM] blissfury
Ouuu! I got a few hundred hours on console


[1/9/2023 8:53 PM] trevlovespizza
Oh I feel that, man. My roommates and I have put a few thousand easily into it. It‚Äôs so weird playing PC now and seeing the huge different in the past five updates. It feels like a brand new game lol


[1/9/2023 8:58 PM] blissfury
I was following the updates for awhile, and was saddened when I heard we weren't getting anymore... a few years ago


[1/9/2023 9:00 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah with TellTale having the rights to the console port and then them shutting down with annoying. Thankfully The Fun Pimps rebought the rights last year and apparently they said there *will* be an update to catch console up this year, but I will believe it when I see it lol A21 releases later this year so who knows. Let‚Äôs hope though. Mods make the pc version so nice though


[1/9/2023 9:16 PM] blissfury
It looks very cartoonist now


[1/9/2023 9:17 PM] blissfury
At least in the images


[1/9/2023 9:33 PM] trevlovespizza
They have changed the textures a lot, it‚Äôs way less ‚Äúgloomy‚Äù than it is on console, but not too cartoony in game, just a lot of different lighting.

[1/17/2023 10:13 PM] otassin
on the very last match of Heatseeker (an online match) the heatseeker servers was down because it was the end so nobody could join and i was left in 1V1, so i played with a guys on 1V1 heatseeker on an online match and we got 10 minutes overtime with 250+ hits, idk if its a world record by itself but on an online match i got my hopes


[1/17/2023 10:16 PM] otassin
and i try to find the world record but i only find a WR from 2020 so i guess nobody cares and/or the actual WR is from 2020 and it was 176 hits that last 7mins and 25secs and it was a private matchs

Honestly his music is super-tailored towards gen z, with his whiny voice, psychedelic beats, and constant anime/video game references‚Ä¶ but imo this is an exciting collab

[1/21/2023 8:43 AM] .codyyy
My dad wanted to say he got better at Fortnite cuz he‚Äôs been playing it (he plays on Xbox) so I went to his house cuz some random mail went there for some reason. So we decided to 1v1 when I got home. Allow me to say the only time he killed me is when I was just messing around trying to kill him. Theeeen I switched to controller cuz I‚Äôm not as good on controller and I still destroyed him. I thought it was so funny. I‚Äôm ass on controller with shooters and I still kept killing him even on it üíÄ


[1/21/2023 8:43 AM] .codyyy
I found it funny cuz he kept saying he got better ü§£


[1/21/2023 8:43 AM] .codyyy
My girlfriend kept laughing watching him on what he was doing


[1/21/2023 8:44 AM] lt_milkshake
Gotta appreciate the effort put in tho. W DAD


[1/21/2023 8:44 AM] .codyyy
Factssss


[1/21/2023 8:45 AM] .codyyy
Well he‚Äôs been top 5 on a game over 10 years ago, called duke nukem forever. If you go on the multiplayer leaderboard on Xbox he is still since it‚Äôs now dead. I would have been easily top 100 or even top 10 if my 360 didn‚Äôt corrupt data


[1/21/2023 8:45 AM] .codyyy
He was better then me in that game for sure besides one nap


[1/21/2023 8:45 AM] .codyyy
Map


[1/21/2023 8:46 AM] .codyyy
He would be top 2-3 if people didn‚Äôt boost their XP


[1/21/2023 8:46 AM] lt_milkshake
Damn, just gotta get that skill back and put him in zero build fn and he‚Äôll fuck everybody


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
Nah that‚Äôs what we did


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
I slayed him


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
ü§£


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
And I don‚Äôt even play Fortnite like that anymore


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
I played a couple weeks ago, 2 games, then before that when no build game out I played for 2-3 weeks


[1/21/2023 8:47 AM] .codyyy
And he def plays more then me


[1/21/2023 8:48 AM] lt_milkshake
I mean the general skills transfer, you know how to be precise and shit from rl


[1/21/2023 8:48 AM] .codyyy
Well


[1/21/2023 8:48 AM] .codyyy
I‚Äôve always played shooters, but I was ass at them(on console) but I got slightly better when I went to pc


[1/21/2023 8:48 AM] lt_milkshake
Figures


[1/21/2023 8:49 AM] .codyyy
I think I‚Äôve only stuck with rl for so long cuz I‚Äôve actually improved on it, unlike any other game


[1/21/2023 8:49 AM] lt_milkshake
Oof


[1/21/2023 8:49 AM] .codyyy
I played COD for so long on console and never improved and it made me sad


[1/21/2023 8:49 AM] .codyyy
Like even with rl, when I switched away from console I got better


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] .codyyy
Higher frames>


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] lt_milkshake
Oh yeah, a platform upgrade does a lot especially on rl


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] lt_milkshake
I got a massive bump just going from ps4 to ps5


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] .codyyy
Console for rl rn doesn‚Äôt matter even if it‚Äôs a new gen


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] .codyyy
It may just look better


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] .codyyy
But frames wise, it‚Äôs still capped at 60


[1/21/2023 8:50 AM] .codyyy
Cuz it‚Äôs only a ‚Äòps4‚Äô game


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] lt_milkshake
Yeah


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] lt_milkshake
There definitely better input delay tho


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] .codyyy
I wonder if unreal engine gets ‚Äòreleased‚Äô on rl, will they upgrade it to new gen consoles


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] .codyyy
I bet


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] .codyyy
I tried playing it on ps5 tho


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] .codyyy
The input delay still sucks compared to pc


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] lt_milkshake
Oh yeah


[1/21/2023 8:51 AM] .codyyy
I was like, never doing that again


[1/21/2023 8:52 AM] lt_milkshake
The difference is so crazy that for a few hours at my friends house I was ass on pc cuz it‚Äôs was so different


[1/21/2023 9:01 AM] .codyyy
Yeah when I switched to pc, it took me two weeks to reach gc, I didn‚Äôt get rewards but I hit it. I was d3-c1, before I switched I maxed to c2 before switching

[1/21/2023 2:59 PM] hoglishva
Funny, first time I got bakkesmod working I roughly said "huh, it's injecting like a hack would". They are probably over reacting since this nexto problem is their first out right hack/cheat. I'm sure bakkes mod and other similar programs will be allowed again once they figure this out.

La prueba de fitness gram pacer es una prueba de capacidad aer√≥bica de varias etapas que progresivamente se vuelve m√°s dif√≠cil a medida que avanza.  Los estudiantes comienzan en la l√≠nea de salida.  Una vez que comienza la prueba, la velocidad de carrera comienza lentamente, pero aumenta cada minuto despu√©s de escuchar la se√±al.

Champ Plat silver and bronze have the best emblems since I'm guessing those turn with the wheel. Plat will sometimes be a correct star, champ can look good on its side or upside down.

I just played with someone who was 2 games of in ssl in 3s. We played ranked, and I was hanging with them in there. literally 2 goals and a bunch of beats


[2/7/2023 11:30 PM] nebula1157
We even won the first game


[2/7/2023 11:33 PM] lt_milkshake
I mean it‚Äôs pretty easy to play-up in your rank. Especially if your tm8s are good, you can play off of them and figure it out from there. You definitely have to already be good at the game in order to do so anyway


[2/7/2023 11:34 PM] nebula1157
One was GC 3 (the one two games off), me a C3, and then a C1


[2/7/2023 11:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i just promoted down to c2 in 2s because of lag  for the 1st 3 matches and i got the same tm8 like 50 million times in a row.


[2/7/2023 11:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
he was so bad


[2/7/2023 11:45 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
like i half want to quit


[2/7/2023 11:48 PM] lt_milkshake
I gave up on ranked for the most part in recent seasons. I‚Äôve honestly really fallen out of rl compared to what I used to. I barely even hit lvl 100 in rocket pass, I used to get well over 300‚Ä¶


[2/7/2023 11:50 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im currently at 109, but y?


[2/7/2023 11:51 PM] lt_milkshake
Honestly idk, I just don‚Äôt play it nearly as much anymore


[2/7/2023 11:52 PM] lt_milkshake
Only thing I can think of is that I play the game less for fun and more to win now so I can‚Äôt be bothered with solo queue whereas b4 I didn‚Äôt care


[2/7/2023 11:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
freestyle?


[2/7/2023 11:53 PM] lt_milkshake
I don‚Äôt nearly have the mechs for that


[2/7/2023 11:53 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[2/7/2023 11:54 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
its called git gud


[2/7/2023 11:55 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im in no way consistent with my mechs enough


[2/7/2023 11:56 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
practice, watch people that are mechy, learn the basics of that specific mechanic, practice


[2/7/2023 11:57 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i have mechanics i just dont know when to use them


[2/7/2023 11:57 PM] lt_milkshake
I also don‚Äôt really have the interest to learn mechs beyond a practical sense


[2/7/2023 11:58 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
hitting clips


[2/7/2023 11:59 PM] lt_milkshake
Here‚Äôs the funny thing with my mechs, if I purposefully go for clips, I fucking suck. If I just play the game and do them when they‚Äôre the best option, I can do crazy shit


[2/8/2023 12:00 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
same

[2/8/2023 5:56 AM] .codyyy

[2/8/2023 4:46 PM] nebula1157
conspiracy theory. If you are looking to play ranked 3s, warm up in 2 games of cas 4's and one cas game of 3's. I did that last night and it seemed like I had a better record and better time recognizing what is happening ect.


[2/8/2023 4:49 PM] hoglishva

If there was any witness reports, it‚Äôs worth reporting that way, I think.


[2/14/2023 12:07 AM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, I have a handful of friends at MSU (they‚Äôre all good), but apparently the reports right now are that he shot himself

[2/18/2023 5:17 PM] hoglishva
FYI outdoor ranges are better for first time shooters, less walls to bounce the sound and blast back at you.

True! Even with the noise cancelling headwear, it was still quite loud

Its good because Jesus was crucified. Let us thank him for the sacrifice he made for the blessing of the forgiveness of all sins. No weapon that forms against you shall prosper, and every tongue, that shall rise against you in judgement, thou shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their vindication is of me declares the LORD. Isaiah 54:17.


[3/3/2023 2:58 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

Bam bang boom done.

Then you must have to go into the channel dedicated settings for rl-announcements and edit the role permissions in there

[3/8/2023 11:30 AM] lt_milkshake
Is that a title?


[3/8/2023 11:30 AM] nebula1157
Yeah


[3/8/2023 11:31 AM] lt_milkshake
I‚Äôll have to see if I have that


[3/8/2023 11:31 AM] lt_milkshake
Since obviously ‚Äúwiz‚Äù is short for wizard


[3/8/2023 11:32 AM] lt_milkshake
*sidenote, once I get a pc my name will just be ‚Äúwiz‚Äù on rl atleast. Since that‚Äôs what everyone calls me anyways


[3/8/2023 11:32 AM] lt_milkshake
There for a while new ppl I met would call me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù but at some point it changed to ‚Äúwiz‚Äù so idk


[3/8/2023 11:34 AM] icybutmelting
I found my perma-title

This is hilarious without context lmao


[3/8/2023 11:35 AM] icybutmelting
Although, once you‚Äôre on PC, unless you have RL on steam, you‚Äôre stuck with epicID naming


[3/8/2023 11:47 AM] lt_milkshake
Can you do repeat names on epic?


[3/8/2023 11:49 AM] lt_milkshake
Or do I gotta worry abt someone already having it?


[3/8/2023 11:52 AM] nebula1157
No


[3/8/2023 11:55 AM] lt_milkshake
So I should probably make my epic that when I get home

[4/4/2023 3:26 PM] nebula1157
I‚Äôll be honest, life is way to short to get mad at each other, take my life for example. I fought with my mother about taking her to the doctor for Covid. She got to sick and passed away a month later, and I never got to say sorry. That‚Äôs a burden I have and don‚Äôt want you guys to have as well, because it really sucks and nothing you do will make it better.


[4/4/2023 3:32 PM] icybutmelting
From a bystanders perspective, @CrazyWiz_26 is unnecessarily hostile towards @Jess the Ness quite often as the first aggressor.


[4/4/2023 3:33 PM] immortalthebud
Lmao end of day it‚Äôs Noah we all know this and personally I like it about him he doesn‚Äôt care and says what‚Äôs in his mind so if he says something that you don‚Äôt like everyone in the server should know if there gonna talk back to him he‚Äôs gonna keep shooting


[4/4/2023 3:34 PM] immortalthebud
So instead of everyone getting involved it‚Äôs done and over we all move on

Nowhere near to the level to warrant some of Wiz‚Äôs responses. As said by Immortal, ignore him. He can be a cunt sometimes


[4/4/2023 5:16 PM] icybutmelting

?


[4/5/2023 6:00 PM] lt_milkshake
‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù is an understatement. Depending on who you are and whether I like you or not. If I like you, it‚Äôs sometimes (in a more busting your balls type way). If I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs basically whenever the fuck you annoy me and I don‚Äôt feel like dealing with it anymore


[4/5/2023 6:11 PM] lt_milkshake
Like I just full on yelled at a kid during lunch who would always come over to my table and act like he‚Äôs the fucking main character of some dumbass sitcom of sum shit. The whole table hated his ass and always complained. He hasn‚Äôt come over to the table since I‚Äôve yelled at him. So obviously me being blunt and a dick worked and solved our issue. It may have mad yet another person in my school not like me and is likely the reason ppl in my grade don‚Äôt like me, but quite frankly, like immortal said, I don‚Äôt care what others think and I‚Äôm quite happy with the friends I have already and I don‚Äôt care to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù and ‚Äúprotect other‚Äôs feelings‚Äù


[4/5/2023 6:13 PM] lt_milkshake
In my opinion, people nowadays care way to much abt what other think. At the end of the day, what matters is that you‚Äôre happy and doing what you love.


[4/5/2023 6:16 PM] lt_milkshake
ANYWAYS, give me some ideas for a new buds logo and banner. Since Trev doesn‚Äôt want it to be rl based since we‚Äôre not only rl anymore and he has no ideas

I love the RL community. One lobby hated me because I demo'ed 3 times and my tm8 was hard chasing. I haven't even said or QC anything and the whole lobby was on my tm8's side. Bro he saved 2 of my shots because I tried to secure it?

Done and done. Took more than 5 minutes, but it was a very thought provoking survey.


[4/27/2023 10:24 PM] .codyyy
I‚Äôm so conflicted. I want a new keyboard but all of ‚Äògood known brands‚Äô seem to feel not very premium for the money you spend on them (like you can hear the springy noise, and such) I was wondering if anyone knew actually good keyboards. ü•∫


[4/27/2023 10:27 PM] lt_milkshake
I can‚Äôt offer any recommendations however I can explain that any nice keyboard is going to make a good bit of noise. Since they all use some sort of mechanical switches. The only ‚Äúquiet‚Äù ones are membrane which are garb for any precision movements


[4/27/2023 10:29 PM] .codyyy
Yeah I know I just don‚Äôt wanna spend 150+ for these known brands (corsair, razer, and all of those) if there are better ones if that makes sense


[4/27/2023 10:30 PM] .codyyy
Like mine (I have a razer black widow v3 pro) and I want a new one cuz I anytime I type m, or t, it‚Äôll be like mmm and it‚Äôs so annoying


[4/27/2023 10:30 PM] .codyyy
And I‚Äôm a harder typer so I think it‚Äôs part of the reason but it used to be fine


[4/27/2023 10:32 PM] lt_milkshake
So what exactly are you after? Cuz there‚Äôs not really such a thing as a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù keyboard. The only differences you‚Äôll ever see are what type of switches are in it (linear,tactile, etc)


[4/27/2023 10:33 PM] .codyyy
Idk I feel like the ‚Äòsilent red switches‚Äô aren‚Äôt actually what I want cuz they aren‚Äôt quiet at all ü§£


[4/27/2023 10:33 PM] .codyyy
Idk much about keyboards that‚Äôs abt why I want input


[4/27/2023 10:33 PM] .codyyy
Mine are the yellow switches from razer and they‚Äôre supposed to be more silent and let me tell you


[4/27/2023 10:33 PM] .codyyy
They are not


[4/27/2023 10:35 PM] lt_milkshake
From my understanding, the type of switch (linear, tactile, etc.) is the primary difference in the audio. But then there‚Äôs different colored switches of each type that can also slightly change the sound


[4/27/2023 10:36 PM] .codyyy
i  just wish i  knew about it to know  exacttly whhatt  iwant

Really only select channels are active


[4/30/2023 1:10 AM] empanada.s
bruh!


[4/30/2023 1:13 AM] lt_milkshake
I mean he‚Äôs not wrong


[4/30/2023 1:17 AM] lt_milkshake
I honestly think it‚Äôs solely because of the XD deleted server. Not that it‚Äôs a bad server or I‚Äôm hating on it, quite the opposite. I think because it has more of a competitive vibe and isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù server like the buds, many of the prominent buds went over there. And because of that, most of the ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù buds haven‚Äôt been joining chat or texting


[4/30/2023 6:32 AM] hamza.egy
Do any one know when the season will be end


[4/30/2023 9:32 AM] trevlovespizza

HOw dare you!


[4/30/2023 2:37 PM] .codyyy
same tho


[4/30/2023 3:41 PM] trevlovespizza
That‚Äôs an easy fix though, just because we‚Äôre not always here, doesn‚Äôt mean we still can‚Äôt play together. Just join a channel and can run bud games at XD, no problem whatsoever!


[4/30/2023 5:45 PM] lt_milkshake
Tbh, there way too many ppl in the xd server for me. The fact that there ends up needing multiple private games just turns into a shit show too much for me


[4/30/2023 5:51 PM] .codyyy
Me and Noah til the end


[4/30/2023 6:03 PM] lt_milkshake

It just became super sensitive

#sosadhowdeadthisserveris


[5/6/2023 5:42 PM] lt_milkshake
Unfortunately that‚Äôs how things like this go. They get a big influx of people that all are active for abt a year and then life starts to get in the way or ppl move on to better things. For ex the xd server


[5/6/2023 5:43 PM] lt_milkshake
And I don‚Äôt think it exactly helped that the unnamed owner üòâ started to focus all their attention elsewhere and leave this in the shadows

{Reactions}
üíØ

[5/6/2023 6:20 PM] icybutmelting
Imo it isn‚Äôt really about having an owner. This is a friend group/community server, not a server under a particular streamer or anything. For me, it‚Äôs a mix of spending more time with my gf, being busy with work, and also, I kinda just started vibing around diff groups where I could join an already popping call instead of having to join an empty one and wait for ppl.


[5/6/2023 6:23 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
It must be tiring being the center of attention icy


[5/6/2023 6:23 PM] lt_milkshake
The owner part was more-less a joke. It may be a big ass coincidence but it does seem to me that once Trev started to become less active here a lot of ppl kinda felt that and followed since a good majority of ppl came from Trev


[5/6/2023 6:25 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs also true, the server was never super popping unless icy was around too. Considering we started calling it the ‚Äúicy effect‚Äù it was obviously pretty apparent


[5/6/2023 6:25 PM] say_grr
To be honest, the iCy effect is real


[5/6/2023 6:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yes


[5/6/2023 6:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
not totally true. trev got me here. im still here


[5/6/2023 6:27 PM] lt_milkshake
But you also grew to be comfortable with other ppl. Like I know personally that I‚Äôve been invited to groups by one person and only been active while they were and so when they left, I left. And I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the case for atleast a few ppl in here


[5/6/2023 6:31 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
huh


[5/6/2023 6:32 PM] lt_milkshake
I‚Äôm saying that there probably ppl in here that we‚Äôre invited by Trev but never became comfortable with others so stopped being active once he was


[5/6/2023 6:33 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i see

[5/7/2023 1:16 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
what other games are played seriously?


[5/7/2023 1:16 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

You could make it all the way Yaviza, Panama just driving. That‚Äôs even past the Panama Canal (there‚Äôs a bridge). However, Dari√©n National Park (the forest that separates north and South America) has no official roads, so you actually can‚Äôt drive from North to South America


[6/5/2023 4:56 PM] icybutmelting

[8/16/2023 5:20 PM] lt_milkshake
Especially since there‚Äôs absolutely nothing to look at the whole time, like all of central PA is just woods and farmland, so it makes the drive feel that much longer

[9/2/2023 2:20 PM] trevlovespizza

sidenote im now a sub for my team instead of a main.


[9/2/2023 2:23 PM] trevlovespizza
Hmm. Bet you'd be a main if you weren't playing on switch


[9/2/2023 2:23 PM] say_grr
It's Switch discrimination


[9/2/2023 2:23 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
perhaps


[9/2/2023 2:23 PM] trevlovespizza
Call the cops


[9/2/2023 2:23 PM] say_grr

[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
Ghosty's team


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] nebula1157
He was on ur team to right?


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] lt_milkshake
Nah, the Xd team are equivalent to Alabama for football, they get so many top tier players you just get replaced hella quick


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] nebula1157
Really?


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
so we have no 3rd rn


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ye


[9/2/2023 2:24 PM] lt_milkshake
He‚Äôs around in Xd every once in awhile


[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
he was. Ghosty picked him up


[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] trevlovespizza
@CrazyWiz_26 Yeah but Alabama actually wins relevant events


[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] lt_milkshake
True


[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] nebula1157

[9/2/2023 2:25 PM] nebula1157
IMAGINE


[9/2/2023 2:26 PM] lt_milkshake
Like I respect the effort from Amazon Prime but like there‚Äôs so many teams and none of them really do anything relevant


[9/2/2023 2:26 PM] nebula1157
Fair


[9/2/2023 2:26 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
except for NC team


[9/2/2023 2:26 PM] trevlovespizza
Yeah, nothing against the pros themselves, or our Buds here, but I feel that. It's okay though! Just gotta get some more teams and then that improves the chances

[9/2/2023 2:27 PM] lt_milkshake
Yeah but think of it this way. If you have 7 out of the 10 teams in an event being under xd and one of them wins, were you really the best?


[9/2/2023 2:28 PM] trevlovespizza
Sarcasm, my friend. üôÇ


[9/2/2023 2:28 PM] nebula1157
That one team was


[9/2/2023 2:28 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

EVerything u need to know abou the new seasn is in the reddit post


[9/5/2023 6:08 PM] .codyyy
I can‚Äôt wait to use the Porsche for a day or so and not use it often after :p


[9/5/2023 6:09 PM] .codyyy
(I haven‚Äôt even been home to update the game or anything so)


[9/5/2023 6:09 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
its the dominus hitbox btw


[9/5/2023 6:09 PM] .codyyy
Oh boy


[9/5/2023 6:09 PM] .codyyy
I don‚Äôt use it often lol


[9/5/2023 6:10 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
im not sure if the update is out yet


[9/5/2023 6:10 PM] .codyyy
I have no idea


[9/5/2023 6:10 PM] .codyyy
I don‚Äôt pay attention to rl update stuff anymore, I just play and that‚Äôs it


[9/5/2023 6:10 PM] lt_milkshake
Bruh that‚Äôs exactly why I hate them bringing our irl cars to the game. The hitbox is never even remotely close


[9/5/2023 6:11 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah, but according to Devin the hybrid hitbox is too tall. Maybe octane, def not the merc and plank is too wide, so


[9/5/2023 6:47 PM] lt_milkshake
That‚Äôs exactly what I mean tho, that‚Äôs the sole reason that‚Äôs cars don‚Äôt ever get used, the hitbox just isn‚Äôt accurate at all


[9/5/2023 9:11 PM] immortalthebud
U guys still play these days?


[9/5/2023 9:11 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[9/16/2023 2:55 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
yeah


[9/16/2023 3:02 PM] kingjayflydenki_okami
i think that regardless of the words, for me anyway, the musical accompaniment is what matters. Although, i do mind the words in the music. But like if im watching an anime and it has a song that goes hard, im not gonna really bother looking up the translation.

Due to gameplay inconsistencies with the arena, Neo Tokyo (Hacked) will be removed from Competitive Playlists. We will re-add the arena when these issues have been corrected in a future update.

Also, id doesn‚Äôt even seem like any of you guys even really acknowledge yourselves as part of the buds anymore.

I‚Äôve talked to Cody many times and this just ain‚Äôt gonna happen


[2/4/2024 11:22 AM] say_grr
Seems to me like the majority of the Buds that are active in chat there would rather be here....  CHILL?????  The few times I went into that chat when it first started are the reason I DON'T EVER go there again.  Making fun of people because of their heritage, like calling arab people ahkbar and more.  Lots of masogeny and more.....


[2/4/2024 11:25 AM] lt_milkshake
Also the environment is a total 180 from the buds. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with deleted but you can very much feel the ‚Äúorganization and its supporters‚Äù vibe whereas the buds used to feel much more ‚Äúhomey‚Äù and like we were truly all close friends that some of us almost considered family

plus I don‚Äôt play rl like I used to anymore. I haven‚Äôt hit c3 in like 3 seasons


[2/4/2024 11:44 AM] lt_milkshake
Also I think part of the reason buds is dead is just that most people moved on. We were really thriving during quarantine when nobody had anything else to do so we all just hung out together on discord but once quarantine ended and most of us went back to school in the fall, just made it harder to get ppl together


[2/4/2024 11:45 AM] .codyyy
Long story short I‚Äôm just gonna keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing, I‚Äôve been having more fun then when I used to join XD‚Äôs vc. Everyone moved on from here. The main people from the buds are doing their own thing, including XD. As it is, buds may stay this way atp


[2/4/2024 11:46 AM] .codyyy
On top of it, RL isn‚Äôt as fun as it used to be for me, Epic is slowly putting it in a grave

[2/4/2024 11:49 AM] lt_milkshake
Yeah, and it‚Äôs hard to wanna grind for a new rank when the rewards other than the title are shit


[2/4/2024 11:49 AM] trevlovespizza

Eh we can all decide to play again, let‚Äôs just think of it as a tiny year long hiatus. Just gotta get the rest of everyone back (ahem @Hoglishva)


[2/4/2024 12:00 PM] immortalthebud
We all just needa choose days that we‚Äôre not busy


[2/4/2024 12:01 PM] immortalthebud
Like I‚Äôm working full time on weekdays now but at night time I‚Äôm always good to get on


[2/4/2024 12:01 PM] trevlovespizza

[2/4/2024 2:50 PM] trevlovespizza

But Rumble doesn't count, Rocket League is dumb regardless

Summary of what you've missed:
- Every pro that was good 2 years ago are probably trash now
- Young French players are dominating RL
- @Trev @Nebula @.J @JohnGoClutch and I now help run a top 16 org in NA with Oath, Ahduhm, and Night (and we have Lawler and Alphakep signed as content creators)
- I sometimes stream and cast their RLCS matches
- This server highkey died and everyone tends to chill in XD (except a few)

Ngl our beginning was a bit tox where we didn't have rules or anything. but we have come such a long way. Epic Games/Psyonix takes 8+ months to pay players a couple hundred dollars of prize winnings. Taking a few months to get **FREE** PCs out to people isn't the most evil thing, right?

Deleted XD is extremely diverse. We‚Äôre all trying our best to improve. That‚Äôs the goal. We‚Äôve given out a lot of free stuff and plan to keep doing so. We‚Äôve built a solid RL community. We‚Äôre supporting a bubble pro team to compete in RLCS. Meanwhile, teams like Omelette and PoaB haven‚Äôt seen a single cent yet from Epic games.

Try being abused for the better part of a decade and then let me know how frustrated you are. How self involved you must be to think you're the only one going through stuff in your personal life. Sit down, stfu, and actually listen to those around you. Prime is a bigot and you see MULTIPLE people telling you this and yet, you still blindly support him. You are who you choose to associate with. 

and stfu with the "not having rules" retoric. I have told you MULTIPLE times that I was on the board and there were rules, you are either lying or perpetuating Prime's lie. Ok let's list SOME of Prime's "mistakes":

Regularly uses homophobic and racial slurs
Bullies this "RL community" you speak about
Silenced the only female in that transphobic religious meeting because they weren't used to the "female opinion"
He was FRIENDS with that religious group and we all voted NO to having them come in and he did it anyway
still attributes HIS downfall to me which is hilarious because it's been others who have picked a bone with him OR have just seen his true colors and want nothing to do with him
He is a misogynist. Calls all women titty streamers with nothing to offer but their looks.
He lies CONSTANTLY and his org is a dictatorship
The DAY my husband assaulted me and was arrested, Prime's main concern after I told him was whether I would be able to still cast the tourney the next day. So yea. Someone who puts 15 random viewers above the safety and concern of their friend, can quite frankly go fuck themselves.

When there is a large number of people (not just women) making their exit from an org and mods deleting their messages saying why, you'd think that would be enough to raise some eyebrows

If you can't see what's wrong with this, I can't cure your blindness

@CrazyWiz_26 howdu like that beating?


[6/24/2024 4:02 AM] lt_milkshake
Do that fucking shit again and watch what happens


[6/24/2024 4:03 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
are you mad??


[6/24/2024 4:07 AM] lt_milkshake
Idk, your having a nice time just playing a ranked mode you don‚Äôt usually and someone purposefully snipes you and happens to get a smurf with hardly any games played and they both decide to jump on your dick like a fucking corner girl in the hood


[6/24/2024 4:08 AM] lt_milkshake
*and proceed to be toxic as fuck for absolutely no reason


[6/24/2024 4:09 AM] lt_milkshake
*and then goes into a server gen chat attempting to brag about it like anyone will actually give two flying fucks


[6/24/2024 4:09 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
ok i get it my bad i didnt think about all that


[6/24/2024 4:10 AM] lt_milkshake
And that match was our tipping point for the rest of the night


[6/24/2024 4:10 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[6/24/2024 4:11 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami

[6/24/2024 4:28 AM] kingjayflydenki_okami
My fault. It was not my intention to ruin you guys evening. Spamming what a save was definitely too much, and then coming into gen chat was also low. I apologize


[6/24/2024 10:55 AM] hockeyhayden0412
nah your good Jay it wasn't that bad looking on it like typically honestly I wouldn't really care but I was already more mad at the game then I had been in a while because like Noah said matchmaking broke we played 2 ssls last night and I rarely play any let alone 2 in one night and then that is jus what did it for me, jus the fact that I was already so mad in the moment made it easier for what happened to piss me off more but don't sweat it your good Jay
